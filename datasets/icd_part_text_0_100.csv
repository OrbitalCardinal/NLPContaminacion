Related

Cholera
is
an
acute
diarrheal
illness
caused
by
infection
of
the
intestine
with
Vibrio
cholerae
bacteria.
People
can
get
sick
when
they
swallow
food
or
water
contaminated
with
cholera
bacteria.
The
infection
is
often
mild
or
without
symptoms,
but
can
sometimes
be
severe
and
life-threatening.
A
physician
checking
a
patient
for
dehydration
About
1
in
10
people
with
cholera
will
experience
severe
symptoms,
which,
in
the
early
stages,
include:
profuse
watery
diarrhea,
sometimes
described
as
“rice-water
stools”
vomiting
thirst
leg
cramps
restlessness
or
irritability
Health
care
providers
should
look
for
signs
of
dehydration
when
examining
a
patient
with
profuse
watery
diarrhea.
These
include:
rapid
heart
rate
loss
of
skin
elasticity
dry
mucous
membranes
low
blood
pressure
People
with
severe
cholera
can
develop
severe
dehydration,
which
can
lead
to
kidney
failure.
If
left
untreated,
severe
dehydration
can
lead
to
shock,
coma,
and
death
within
hours.
Person
washing
hands
over
a
bucket
of
water.
The
profuse
diarrhea
produced
by
cholera
patients
contains
large
amounts
of
the
infectious
Vibrio
cholerae
germ
that
can
infect
others
if
swallowed.
This
can
happen
when
the
bacteria
get
on
food
or
into
water.
To
prevent
the
bacteria
from
spreading,
all
feces
(human
waste)
from
sick
persons
should
be
thrown
away
carefully
to
ensure
it
does
not
contaminate
anything
nearby.
People
caring
for
cholera
patients
must
wash
their
hands thoroughly
after
touching
anything
that
might
be
contaminated
with
patients’
feces
(poop).
When
cholera
patients
are
treated
quickly,
they
usually
recover
without
long-term
consequences.
Cholera
patients
do
not
typically
become
carriers
of
the
cholera
bacteria
after
they
recover,
but
they
get
sick
if
exposed
again.

cholerae
is
a
gram
negative,
non-spore
forming,
curved
rod
bacterium
that
contains
a
motile
flagellum.
It
is
a
facultative
anaerobe
and
part
of
the
Vibronaceae
family.
There
are
over
200
subtypes,

is
an
epidemic
serogroup
of
Vibrio

isolated
in

can
cause

infection.PathogenicityPathogenic
Vibrio
serogroups
produce
cholera
toxin
while
non-pathogenic
strains
may
or
may
not
produce
this
toxin
but
can
still
cause
illness
in
humans.
Symptoms
often
depend
on
the
strain
and
severity
of
illness.
N16961
is
a
pathogenic
strain.
In
serious
cases
of
cholera
involving
severe
dehydration,
up
to
60%
of
patients
can
die.
However,
with
rehydration
therapy,
less
than
1%
of
cases
are
fatal.
The
disease
typically
lasts
from
4-6
days
depending
on
treatment.In
2002,
the
World
Health
Organization
announced
the
fatality
ratio
for
cholera
was
about
4%.
Special
Populations
at
RiskIn
untreated
children,
death
secondary
to
dehydration
can
happen
in
a
matter
of
hours
or
days.
In
addition,
cholera
infection
in
pregnant
women
and
their
fetuses
may
lead
to
premature
labor
and
fetal
death.Biosafety

An
acute
diarrheal
disease
endemic
in
India
and
southeast
Asia
whose
causative
agent
is
vibrio
cholerae.
This
condition
can
lead
to
severe
dehydration
in
a
matter
of
hours
unless
quickly
treated.
Cholera
is
a
bacterial
infection
that
causes
diarrhea.
The
cholera
bacterium
is
usually
found
in
water
or
food
contaminated
by
feces
.
Cholera
is
rare
in
the
United
States.
You
may
get
it
if
you
travel
to
parts
of
the
world
with
inadequate
water
treatment
and
poor
sanitation,
and
lack
of
sewage
treatment.
Outbreaks
can
also
happen
after
disasters.
The
disease
is
not
likely
to
spread
directly
from
one
person
to
another.
Often
the
infection
is
mild
or
without
symptoms,
but
sometimes
it
can
be
severe.
Severe
symptoms
include
profuse
watery
diarrhea,
vomiting,
and
leg
cramps.
In
severe
cases,
rapid
loss
of
body
fluids
leads
to
dehydration
and
shock.
Without
treatment,
death
can
occur
within
hours.
Doctors
diagnose
cholera
with
a
stool
sample
or
rectal
swab.
Treatment
includes
replacing
fluid
and
salts
and
sometimes
antibiotics.
Anyone
who
thinks
they
may
have
cholera
should
seek
medical
attention
immediately.
Dehydration
can
be
rapid
so
fluid
replacement
is
essential.

What
are
the
signs
and
symptoms
of
typhoid
fever
and
paratyphoid
fever?
Typhoid
fever
and
paratyphoid
fever
have
similar
symptoms̵.
People
usually
have
a
sustained
fever
(one
that
doesn’t
come
and
go)
that
can
be
as
high
as
103–104°F
(39–40°C).
Other
symptoms
of
typhoid
fever
and
paratyphoid
fever
include
Weakness
Stomach
pain
Headache
Diarrhea
or
constipation
Cough
Loss
of
appetite
Some
people
with
typhoid
fever
or
paratyphoid
fever
develop
a
rash
of
flat,
rose-colored
spots.
What
do
you
do
if
you
think
you
have
typhoid
fever
or
paratyphoid
fever?
The
only
way
to
know
for
sure
if
an
illness
is
typhoid
fever
or
paratyphoid
fever
is
to
have
a
sample
of
blood
or
stool
(poop)
tested
for
Salmonella
Typhi
or
Salmonella
Paratyphi.
If
you
have
a
fever
and
feel
very
ill,
see
a
doctor
immediately.
If
you
are
traveling
outside
the
United
States,
you
usually

paratyphoid
fever,
infectious
disease
caused
by
any
of
several
organisms:
Salmonella
paratyphi
(paratyphi
A),
S.
schottmuelleri
(paratyphi
B),
or
S.
hirschfeldii
(paratyphi
C).
S.
paratyphi
is
the
cause
of
paratyphoid
fever
in
humans
and
is
common
in
areas
of
Asia,
Africa,
the
Middle
East,
and
Central
and
South
America.In
humans,
the
means
of
infection,
spread,
pathology,
diagnosis,
prevention,
and
treatment
of
paratyphoid
fever
are
similar
to
those
for
typhoid
fever.
Thus,
infection
typically
occurs
by
eating
or
drinking
food
or
water
that
is
contaminated
with
feces
or
urine
from
individuals
with
the
disease.
Contact
with
an
infected
person
can
also
result
in
transmission.
Foods
frequently
associated
with
paratyphoid
fever
include
milk,
raw
fruits
and
vegetables,
and
shellfish.
Symptoms
appear
anywhere
from
1
to
10
days
after
exposure
and
generally
include
diarrhea,
fatigue,
fever,
headache,
loss
of
appetite,
and
sometimes
skin
rash,
particularly
on
the
chest.
Some
individuals
are
asymptomatic.
Paratyphoid
fever
may
be
fatal
if
left
untreated.
Infection
is
effectively
treated
with
antibiotic
therapy.

Patient’s
editorial
guidelines
Typhoid
and
paratyphoid
fever
are
infections
caused
by
related
but
different
strains
of
germs
(bacteria).
The
two
diseases
are
similar,
and
are
both
called
enteric
fevers,
although
paratyphoid
is
less
severe.
They
are
usually
caught
through
the
intake
(ingestion)
of
contaminated
food
or
water.
These
infections
are
most
common
in
countries
with
poor
sanitation.
Common
initial
symptoms
are
high
temperature
(fever)
and
headache
but
more
serious
problems
can
develop
if
not
treated.
Treatment
with
antibiotic
medication
usually
works
well.
Without
treatment,
about
1
in
5
people
with
typhoid
die,
although
paratyphoid
is
not
usually
fatal.
Careful
hand
washing
and
drinking
bottled
water
can
help
to
prevent
you
from
getting
typhoid.
You
should
also
boil,
cook
or
peel
food
before
eating
it
while
in
areas
where
typhoid
is
common.
Vaccines
can
also
help
to
prevent
typhoid,
so
it
is
sensible
to
be
vaccinated
before
you
travel
to
an
area
where
the
risk
of
typhoid
is
significant.In

What
are
typhoid
and
paratyphoid
fever?Typhoid
fever
is
an
infection
caused
by
the
germ
(bacterium)
Salmonella
typhi.
This
can
cause
a
serious
illness
which
can
be
fatal
if
not
treated
rapidly
with
antibiotics.Paratyphoid
fever
is
an
infection
which
is
similar
but
has
milder
symptoms.
This
is
caused
by
the
bacterium
Salmonella
paratyphi.
There
are
three
strains
of
Salmonella
paratyphoid:
often
called
strains
A
B
and
C.
A
is
the
most
common
worldwide,
although
B
is
more
common
in
Europe.
C
is
rare.The
bacteria
are
shortened
to
S.
typhi
and
S.
paratyphi
for
the
remainder
of
this
leaflet.The
diseases
are
known
by
various
other
names,
such
as
gastric
fever,
enteric
fever,
abdominal
typhus,
infantile
remittent
fever,
slow
fever,
nervous
fever
and
pythogenic
fever.
The
name
typhoid
means
'resembling
typhus'.
However,
although
there
can
be
some
similar
symptoms,
typhus
is
a
completely
separate
disease.Where
are
typhoid
and
paratyphoid
fever
most
commonly
found?The
germs
(bacteria)
causing
typhoid
and
paratyphoid
fever
are
found
most
commonly
in
situations
where:Good
standards
of
hygiene
are
not
maintained.Good
standards
of
hygiene
cannot
be
maintained
because
of
the
lack
of
clean
running
water
and
of
the
safe
disposal
of
waste
water.According
to
the
World
Health
Organization
(WHO),
typhoid
and
paratyphoid
fever
are
now
most
commonly
found
in
Southeast
Asia
and
sub-Saharan
Africa.On
a
worldwide
scale,
the
occurrence
of
typhoid
and
paratyphoid
fever
reduced
dramatically
through
the
twentieth
century.
This
was
partly
due
to
improved
access
to
clean
water
and
sanitation
and
to
better
understanding
of
hygiene.
It
was
also
due
to
the
discovery
of
antibiotics
which
can
treat
the
disease.In
the
UK,
typhoid
and
paratyphoid
fever
are
called
notifiable
diseases.
This
means
that
if
you
are
found
to
be
infected
with
one
or
the
other
your
doctor
is
obliged
to
inform
the
local
public
health
doctors.
They
have
a
responsibility
for
monitoring
and
responding
to
disease
outbreaks
in
the
community.
The
public
health
doctors
will
want
to
know
where
you
acquired
the
infection,
to
make
sure
there
is
no
public
health
risk.
The
most
common
infections
in
the
UK
in
recent
years
have
been
among
people
who
have
visited
friends
and
family
in
the
Indian
subcontinent.
Each
year
there
are
about
500
cases
of
typhoid
in
the
UK
in
people
returning
from
these
areas.
About
half
are
in
London.If
you're
travelling,
you
can
find
out
if
a
country
you're
visiting
carries
a
high
risk
of
typhoid
by
visiting
the
NHS
Fitorftravel
website.How
do
you
get
these
infections?You
get
these
infections
from
other
infected
people
by
eating
or
drinking
contaminated
food
or
water.
The
germs
(bacteria)
are
passed
out
in
the
stools
(faeces)
and
urine
of
infected
individuals.
They
can
get
into
food
and
water
because
people
who
handle
food
(such
as
cooks
or
restaurant
workers)
may
not
know
that
they
are
infected.
It
is
possible
to
have
typhoid
or
paratyphoid
fever
but
to
have
no
symptoms
or
signs
of
the
infection.
Humans
are
the
only
carriers
of
these
infections.Typhoid
and
paratyphoid
fever
are
not
passed
on
by
animals.How
do
typhoid
and
paratyphoid
fever
make
you
ill?The
germs
(bacteria)
enter
your
body
through
the
gut.
They
sit
in
your
immune
system
(glands
and
lymph
vessels)
and
multiply
there.
They
then
enter
the
bloodstream,
which
is
when
most
people
experience
symptoms
of
headache
and
high
temperature
(fever).
Through
the
bloodstream
they
enter
various
organs,
particularly
the
liver,
spleen,
gallbladder
and
bone
marrow.
Because
bile
produced
by
the
gallbladder
is
squirted
into
the
gut,
the
bowels
then
get
infected
again.Symptoms
of
typhoid
feverThe
incubation
period
is
the
time
from
ingesting
the
germs
(bacteria)
until
the
time
you
actually
start
to
feel
ill.
It
depends
on
how
many
bacteria
you
have
swallowed.
It
is
usually
between
seven
and
fourteen
days,
but
can
be
as
short
as
three
days,
or
as
long
as
30
days.
Untreated,
the
illness
usually
lasts
for
three
to
four
weeks,
but
may
be
longer
in
a
small
number
of
cases.
Symptoms
vary
from
mild
to
severe
and
life-threatening.
Lack
of
fluid
in
the
body
(dehydration)
is
a
risk.About
1
in
300
people
infected
with
typhoid
fever
may
have
a
low-grade
infection.
They
may
not
develop
any
significant
symptoms,
and
then
become
carriers
of
the
disease.Raised
temperature
(fever)
and
headache
are
the
most
common
symptoms.
Typically,
the
temperature
increases
gradually
day
by
day
during
the
first
week.
People
usually
experience
raised
temperature
mostly
in
the
evenings.Rash
(rose-coloured
spots
which
lose
their
colour
with
pressure).Stomach
pains.Loss
of
appetite.Diarrhoea
-
more
common
in
children.Severe
constipation
-
more
common
in
adults.Feeling
sick
(nausea).Cough.The
typical
pattern
of
illness
consists
of
four
stages,
each
lasting
about
a
week.
Over
the
course
of
these
stages,
you
become
tired
and
may
lose
weight
dramatically.In
the
first
week,
the
body
temperature
rises
slowly,
and
may
go
up
and
down,
with
headache,
cough
and
feeling
unwell.
Nosebleeds
are
common.In
the
second
week
there
is
a
high
fever
of
around
40°C
(104°F)
-
often
worse
in
the
afternoon
-
although
the
pulse
is
often
slower
than
expected
with
a
high
fever.
Some
patients
get
'rose
spots'
on
the
lower
chest
and
stomach.
Some
patients
become
confused
('delirious')
with
the
fever,
which
earned
typhoid
the
name
'nervous
fever'.
Tummy
pain
and
diarrhoea
are
common,
and
stools
(faeces)
are
often
green.
There
may
be
swelling
of
the
liver
and
spleen,
which
your
doctor
may
be
able
to
feel.In
the
third
week
of
typhoid
fever,
serious
complications
can
occur
(see
below).By
the
end
of
third
week,
the
fever
starts
subsiding.
This
carries
on
into
the
fourth
and
final
week.Symptoms
of
paratyphoid
feverParatyphoid
fever
is
similar
to
typhoid;
but
it
tends
to
come
on
more
quickly,
have
milder
symptoms,
and
last
for
a
shorter
time.Early
symptoms
can
be
vague
chills,
sweating,
headache,
weakness,
cough,
loss
of
appetite,
sore
throat,
dizziness
and
muscle
pains.
These
are
frequently
present
before
the
onset
of
high
temperature
(fever).Symptoms
of
paratyphoid
are
of:Persistent
fever.Headache.Tummy
(abdominal)
pain
(in
about
a
third
of
patients).Feeling
unwell.Loss
of
appetite.Dry
cough
(this
occurs
early).Slow
heart
rate.Swelling
of
the
liver
and
spleen.Rosy
spots
on
the
central
body
(in
about
a
third
of
patients).Constipation
(more
common
than
diarrhoea).Very
rarely,
patients
can
suffer
mental
disorder
(psychosis),
confusion,
and
seizures.What
are
the
possible
complications?About
1
in
10
people
with
typhoid
or
paratyphoid
fever
infections
have
complications.
These
can
occur
at
any
time
while
you
have
the
infection,
even
if
you
have
a
mild
infection.The
two
most
common
complications
are
bleeding
from
the
bowel
and
rupture
(perforation)
of
the
bowel.
These
occur
in
about
2
in
100
cases.
These
may
be
life-threatening
and
may
require
a
surgical
operation.Other
possible
complications
include:Infection
of
the
heart
muscle
(myocarditis)
occurs
in
up
to
1
in
20
cases.
It
is
a
significant
cause
of
death
in
areas
where
typhoid
and
paratyphoid
fever
are
commonly
found.Infection
of
the
nervous
system
(encephalitis)
can
cause
severe
confusion,
epileptic
seizures
and
mental
health
disturbances.Liver
and
gallbladder
infection
may
cause
yellowing
of
the
skin
and
of
the
whites
of
the
eyes
(jaundice)
and
severe
tummy
(abdominal)
pain.Inflammation
of
the
pancreas
(pancreatitis)
is
very
rare.
This
can
cause
severe
pain
in
the
stomach
or
back,
and
indigestion.Kidney
failure
(in
which
the
kidneys
no
longer
clear
toxins
from
the
blood)
is
also
uncommon.Abscesses
around
the
body.Lack
of
fluid
in
the
body
(dehydration).Uncommonly,
a
fall
in
the
platelet
cells
in
the
blood
which
leads
to
bruising
and
bleeding.Note:
if
you
have
any
new
symptoms,
or
feel
worse
while
you
are
being
treated
for
typhoid,
you
should
contact
your
doctor
as
soon
as
possible.When
to
seek
medical
adviceBe
aware
if
you
or
your
child
have
travelled
to
an
area
known
to
have
a
risk
of
typhoid
infections,
or
have
been
in
a
situation
where
hygiene
has
been
poor.
If
you
experience
headache,
high
temperature
(fever),
tummy
(abdominal)
pains,
cough
or
diarrhoea
you
should
seek
medical
advice.
This
is
the
case
even
if
you
have
been
vaccinated
against
typhoid
fever,
as
vaccination
does
not
guarantee
complete
protection.How
are
typhoid
and
paratyphoid
fever
diagnosed?Your
doctor
will
take
note
of
where
you
travelled,
the
conditions
you
stayed
in
and
what
you
did
while
you
were
there.
He
or
she
will
ask
about
your
symptoms,
and
will
examine
you.
These
are
all
very
important,
as
it
is
very
difficult
to
find
typhoid
and
paratyphoid
fever
in
the
body,
even
if
you
have
these
infections.Tests
your
doctor
may
carry
outStool
(faeces),
blood
and
urine
samples
are
sent
to
the
laboratory
for
culture
(in
which
the
germs
(bacteria)
are
helped
to
reproduce
and
be
identified).
This
test
may
fail
to
identify
about
one
third
of
cases
even
when
bacteria
are
present.
It
may
also
take
some
days
for
results
to
come
back.Widal's
test
-
this
is
a
blood
test
which
checks
for
proteins
(antibodies)
which
help
to
fight
S.
typhi
or
S.
paratyphi.
Again,
however,
this
may
miss
about
one
third
of
cases.Bone
marrow
aspiration
-
a
needle
is
used
to
take
a
sample
of
bone
marrow
fluid.
A
bone
marrow
sample
is
positive
in
90%
of
cases
if
it
is
taken
during
the
first
week
of
the
illness.
It
may
be
more
difficult
to
find
after
that.If
your
travel
history
and
symptoms
suggest
that
you
have
typhoid
or
paratyphoid
fever,
the
doctor
may
start
treatment
before
the
results
of
the
tests
are
available.What
are
the
treatments
for
typhoid
and
paratyphoid
fever?You
may
need
to
be
admitted
to
hospital
for
these
infections
to
be
treated.Antibiotic
medication:
this
should
be
started
as
soon
as
possible.
Antibiotics
will
reduce
your
chances
of
serious
complications.
They
will
also
make
you
feel
better
more
quickly.
You
will
be
asked
to
keep
taking
them
until
six
consecutive
negative
stool
(faeces)
and
urine
tests
have
been
obtained.Have
plenty
to
drink
to
prevent
lack
of
fluid
in
the
body
(dehydration).
Sometimes
a
drip
where
fluid
is
put
directly
into
the
vein
is
needed.Medication
to
lower
your
temperature
may
be
needed.Those
caring
for
you
must
be
particularly
careful
with
hand
washing
and
the
disposal
of
faeces
and
urine.
If
you
are
looking
after
a
friend
or
relative
with
typhoid
or
paratyphoid
infection
then
observe
the
best
possible
hand
washing
techniques
and
hygiene
practices.How
to
wash
your
hands
properlyWet
both
hands
with
water.Cover
both
hands
with
soap.Rub
your
palms
and
in
between
your
fingers
together.Rub
the
backs
of
your
hands
and
in
between
your
fingers.Interlock
your
fingers
and
rub
the
tips
of
your
fingers
and
nails
together.Wash
each
thumb
including
the
nail
separately
with
each
hand.Rinse
both
hands
thoroughly.Dry
hands
with
a
single-use
hand
towel
or
a
hand
dryer.Use
the
towel
to
turn
off
the
tap.Safe
disposal
of
urine
and
faecesIt
is
best
to
flush
urine
and
faeces
into
the
toilet
immediately.Make
sure
the
toilet
is
cleaned
with
disinfectant
dailyIf
a
potty
is
used,
flush
the
contents
into
the
toilet.Wash
the
potty
with
warm
water
and
disinfectant.Turn
it
upside
down
to
dry.If
a
nappy
is
worn,
change
the
nappy,
using
gloves
if
possible.Flush
any
faeces
into
the
toilet.Always
make
sure
you
wash
your
hands
thoroughly
after
changing
the
nappy.If
sheets,
bedding
or
clothes
are
soiled,
remove
them
as
soon
as
possible
using
gloves
if
they
are
available.
Wash
them
separately
from
unsoiled
items,
with
hot
water.Wash
your
hands
after
handling
the
soiled
items.Advice
for
people
who
work
with
foodTyphoid
and
paratyphoid
are
known
to
be
easy
to
pass
on,
even
after
symptoms
have
stopped
and
you
feel
better.
If
you
work
with
food,
you
should
inform
your
employer
if:You
have,
or
are
suspected
of
having,
typhoid
or
paratyphoid
fever.You
have
had
it
in
the
past.You
have
had
contact
with
someone
who
has
had
typhoid
or
paratyphoid
fever.You
should
be
excluded
from
food
handling
and
food
handling
areas
until
you
have
been
cleared
to
return
to
work
by
a
medical
professional.
If
the
person
is
confirmed
as
being
infected
or
is
a
carrier
of
the
germs
(bacteria),
the
exclusion
period
may
take
three
months
or
more.
This
is
to
allow
for
treatment
and
confirmation
of
clearance
of
infection,
through
stool
testing.How
long
should
someone
with
typhoid
or
paratyphoid
fever
stay
away
from
work,
school
or
nursery?Adults
and
children
aged
over
5
years
can
go
back
to
work/school
as
soon
as
their
illness
is
better,
and
they
have
no
diarrhoea.
They
must
continue
to
observe
good
standards
of
hygiene
and
hand
washing.
An
exception
to
this
is
if
you
work
with
food
(see
section
above),
in
which
case
you
need
to
be
fully
cleared
by
a
health
professional
to
return
to
work.
In
the
UK,
public
health
doctors
are
likely
to
be
involved
in
advising
when
it
is
safe
for
you
to
return.People
working
with
vulnerable
groups
such
as
the
very
young,
elderly
or
those
in
poor
health,
should
tell
their
employer
of
their
illness.
They
must
also
stay
off
work
until
tests
show
that
the
germs
(bacteria)
have
cleared
from
stool
(faeces)
specimens
in
three
stool
samples
taken
at
weekly
intervals.Children
aged
under
5
years
should
stay
away
from
nurseries,
playgroups,
etc,
until
tests
show
that
the
bacteria
have
cleared
from
stool
specimens
in
three
stool
samples
taken
at
weekly
intervals.What
is
the
outlook
(prognosis)?Without
antibiotics,
about
1
in
5
people
will
die
from
a
typhoid
infection.
Paratyphoid
is
not
usually
fatal.With
treatment
with
antibiotics,
most
people
make
a
full
recovery
but
about
1
in
10
people
have
a
recurrence
of
the
illness
(relapse).
This
usually
happens
a
week
after
stopping
the
antibiotics
but
it
can
be
much
later.
A
further
course
of
antibiotics
will
usually
work
if
you
have
a
relapse.How
can
I
prevent
getting
typhoid
or
paratyphoid
fever?Avoid
getting
typhoid
and
paratyphoid
fever

Paratyphoid
fever,
also
known
simply
as
paratyphoid,
is
a
bacterial
infection
caused
by
one
of
the
three
types
of
Salmonella
enterica.[1]
Symptoms
usually
begin
6–30
days
after
exposure
and
are
the
same
as
those
of
typhoid
fever.[1][3]
Often,
a
gradual
onset
of
a
high
fever
occurs
over
several
days.[1]
Weakness,
loss
of
appetite,
and
headaches
also
commonly
occur.[1]
Some
people
develop
a
skin
rash
with
rose-colored
spots.[2]
Without
treatment,
symptoms
may
last
weeks
or
months.[1]
Other
people
may
carry
the
bacteria
without
being
affected;
however,
they
are
still
able
to
spread
the
disease
to
others.[3]
Typhoid
and
paratyphoid
are
of
similar
severity.[3]
Paratyphoid
and
typhoid
fever
are
types
of
enteric
fever.[7]
Paratyphoid
is
caused
by
the
bacterium
Salmonella
enterica
of
the
serotypes
Paratyphi
A,
Paratyphi
B,
or
Paratyphi
C
growing
in
the
intestines
and
blood.[1]
They
are
usually
spread
by
eating
or
drinking
food
or
water
contaminated
with
the
feces
of
an
infected
person.[1]
They
may
occur
when
a
person
who
prepares
food
is
infected.[2]
Risk
factors
include
poor
sanitation
as
is
found
among
poor
crowded
populations.[4]
Occasionally,
they
may
be
transmitted
by
sex.[1]
Humans
are
the
only
animals
infected.[1]
Diagnosis
may
be
based
on
symptoms
and
confirmed
by
either
culturing
the
bacteria
or
detecting
the
bacterial
DNA
in
the
blood,
stool,
or
bone
marrow.[1][3]
Culturing
the
bacteria
can
be
difficult.[3]
Bone-marrow
testing
is
the
most
accurate.[4]
Symptoms
are
similar
to
that
of
many
other
infectious
diseases.[3]
Typhus
is
a
different
disease.[8]
While
no
vaccine
is
available
specifically
for
paratyphoid,
the
typhoid
vaccine
may
provide
some
benefit.[1][2]
Prevention
includes
drinking
clean
water,
better
sanitation,
and
better
handwashing.[1]
Treatment
of
the
disease
is
with
antibiotics
such
as
azithromycin.[1]
Resistance
to
a
number
of
other
previously
effective
antibiotics
is
common.[1]
Paratyphoid
affects
about
six
million
people
a
year.[1][9]
It
is
most
common
in
parts
of
Asia
and
rare
in
the
developed
world.[1][2]
Most
cases
are
due
to
Paratyphi
A
rather
than
Paratyphi
B
or
C.[3]
In
2015,
paratyphoid
fever
resulted
in
about
29,200
deaths,
down
from
63,000
deaths
in
1990.[10][6]
The
risk
of
death
is
between
10
and
15%
without
treatment,
while
with
treatment,
it
may
be
less
than
1%.[3]

Signs
and
symptoms[edit]
Rose
spots
on
abdomen
of
a
person
with
typhoid
fever
Paratyphoid
fever
resembles
typhoid
fever.
Infection
is
characterized
by
a
sustained
fever,
headache,
abdominal
pain,
malaise,
anorexia,
a
nonproductive
cough
(in
early
stage
of
illness),
a
relative
bradycardia
(slow
heart
rate),
and
hepatosplenomegaly
(an
enlargement
of
the
liver
and
spleen).
About
30%
of
Caucasians
develop
rosy
spots
on
the
central
body.
In
adults,
constipation
is
more
common
than
diarrhea.[citation
needed]
Only
20
to
40%
of
people
initially
have
abdominal
pain.
Nonspecific
symptoms
such
as
chills,
sweating,
headache,
loss
of
appetite,
cough,
weakness,
sore
throat,
dizziness,
and
muscle
pains
are
frequently
present
before
the
onset
of
fever.
Some
very
rare
symptoms
are
psychosis
(mental
disorder),
confusion,
and
seizures.[citation
needed]
Cause[edit]
Paratyphoid
fever
is
caused
by
any
of
three
serovars
of
Salmonella
enterica
subsp.
enterica:
S.
Paratyphi
A,
S.
Paratyphi
B
(invalid
alias
S.
schottmuelleri),
S.
Paratyphi
C
(invalid
alias
S.
hirschfeldii).[citation
needed]
Transmission[edit]
They
are
usually
spread
by
eating
or
drinking
food
or
water
contaminated
with
the
feces
of
an
infected
person.[1]
They
may
occur
when
a
person
who
prepares
food
is
infected.[2]
Risk
factors
include
poor
sanitation
as
is
found
among
poor
crowded
populations.[4]
Occasionally,
they
may
be
transmitted
by
sex.
Humans
are
the
only
animals
infected.[1]
Paratyphoid
B[edit]
Paratyphoid
B
is
more
frequent
in
Europe.
It
can
present
as
a
typhoid-like
illness,
as
a
severe
gastroenteritis
or
with
features
of
both.
Herpes
labialis,
rare
in
true
typhoid
fever,
is
frequently
seen
in
paratyphoid
B.
Rarely
a
subdural
empyema
can
occur.[11]
Diagnosis
is
with
isolation
of
the
agent
in
blood
or
stool
and
demonstration
of
antibodies
antiBH
in
the
Widal
test.
The
disease
responds
well
to
chloramphenicol
or
co-trimoxazole.[citation
needed]
Paratyphoid
C[edit]
Paratyphoid
C
is
a
rare
infection,
generally
seen
in
the
Far
East.
It
presents
as
a
septicaemia
with
metastatic
abscesses.
Cholecystitis
is
possible
in
the
course
of
the
disease.
Antibodies
to
paratyphoid
C
are
not
usually
tested
and
the
diagnosis
is
made
with
blood
cultures.
Chloramphenicol
therapy
is
generally
effective.[citation
needed]
Carriers[edit]
Humans
and,
occasionally,
domestic
animals
are
the
carriers
of
paratyphoid
fever.
Members
of
the
same
family
can
be
transient
or
permanent
carriers.
In
most
parts
of
the
world,
short-term
fecal
carriers
are
more
common
than
urinary
carriers.
The
chronic
urinary
carrier
state
occurs
in
those
who
have
schistosomiasis
(parasitic
blood
fluke).[citation
needed]
Continuing
to
shed
Salmonella
Paratyphi
is
possible
for
up
to
one
year,
and
during
this
phase,
a
person
is
considered
to
be
a
carrier.
The
chronic
carrier
state
may
follow
acute
illness,
or
mild
or
even
subclinical
infections.
Chronic
carriers
are
most
often
women
who
were
infected
in
their
middle
age.[citation

Pathophysiology[edit]
After
ingestion,
if
the
immune
system
is
unable
to
stop
the
infection,
the
bacteria
multiply
and
then
spread
to
the
bloodstream,
after
which
the
first
signs
of
disease
are
observed
in
the
form
of
fever.
They
penetrate
further
to
the
bone
marrow,
liver,
and
bile
ducts,
from
which
bacteria
are
excreted
into
the
bowel
contents.
In
the
second
phase
of
the
disease,
the
bacteria
penetrate
the
immune
tissue
of
the
small
intestine,
and
the
initial
symptoms
of
small-bowel
movements
begin.[citation
needed]
Prevention[edit]
Providing
basic
sanitation
and
safe
drinking
water
and
food
are
the
keys
for
controlling
the
disease.
In
developed
countries,
enteric
fever
rates
decreased
in
the
past
when
treatment
of
municipal
water
was
introduced,
human
feces
were
excluded
from
food
production,
and
pasteurization
of
dairy
products
began.[4]
In
addition,
children
and
adults
should
be
carefully
educated
about
personal
hygiene.
This
would
include
careful
handwashing
after
defecation
and
sexual
contact,
before
preparing
or
eating
food,
and
especially
the
sanitary
disposal
of
feces.
Food
handlers
should
be
educated
in
personal
hygiene
prior
to
handling
food
or
utensils
and
equipment.
Infected
individuals
should
be
advised
to
avoid
food
preparation.
Sexually
active
people
should
be
educated
about
the
risks
of
sexual
practices
that
permit
fecal-oral
contact.[12]
Those
who
travel
to
countries
with
poor
sanitation
should
receive
a
live
attenuated
typhoid
vaccine—Ty21a
(Vivotif),
which,
in
addition
to
the
protection
against
typhoid
fever,
may
provide
some
protection
against
paratyphoid
fever
caused
by
the
S.
enterica
serotypes
A
and
B.[4]
In
particular,
a
reanalysis
of
data
from
a
trial
conducted
in
Chile
showed
the
Ty21a
vaccine
was
49%
effective
(95%
CI:
8–73%)
in
preventing
paratyphoid
fever
caused
by
the
serotype
B.[13]
Evidence
from
a
study
of
international
travelers
in
Israel
also
indicates
the
vaccine
may
prevent
a
fraction
of
infections
by
the
serotype
A,
although
no
trial
confirms
this.[14]
This
cross-protection
by
a
typhoid
vaccine
is
most
likely
due
to
O
antigens
shared
between
different
S.
enterica
serotypes.[14]
Exclusion
from
work
and
social
activities
should
be
considered
for
symptomatic,
and
asymptomatic
people
who
are
food
handlers,
healthcare/daycare
staff
who
are
involved
in
patient
care
and/or
child
care,
children
attending
unsanitary
daycare
centers,
and
older
children
who
are
unable
to
implement
good
standards
of
personal
hygiene.
The
exclusion
applies
until
two
consecutive
stool
specimens
are
taken
from
the
infected
patient
and
are
reported
negative.[citation
needed]
Treatments[edit]
Control
requires
treatment
of
antibiotics
and
vaccines
prescribed
by
a
doctor.
Major
control
treatments
for
paratyphoid
fever
include
ciprofloxacin
for
10
days,
ceftriaxone/cefotaxime
for
14
days,
or
aziththromycin.[citation
needed]
Prognosis[edit]
Those
diagnosed
with
Type
A
of
the
bacterial
strain
rarely
die
from
it
except
in
rare
cases
of
severe
intestinal
complications.
With
proper
testing
and
diagnosis,
the
mortality
rate
falls
to
less
than
1%.
Antibiotics
such
as
azithromycin
are
particularly
effective
in
treating
the
disease.[15]
Epidemiology[edit]
Factors
outside
the
household,
such
as
unclean
food
from
street
vendors
and
flooding,
help
distribute
the
disease
from
person
to
person.[12]
Because
of
poverty
and
poor
hygiene
and
insanitary
conditions,
the
disease
is
more
common
in
less-industrialized
countries,
principally
owing
to
the
problem
of
unsafe
drinking
water,
inadequate
sewage
disposal,
and
flooding.[16]
Occasionally
causing
epidemics,
paratyphoid
fever
is
found
in
large
parts
of
Asia,
Africa,
and
Central
and
South
America.
Many
of
those
infected
get
the
disease
in
Asian
countries.
About
16
million
cases
occur
a
year,
which
result
in
about
25,000
deaths
worldwide.[17]

What
are
Salmonella?
Salmonella
are
bacteria
that
make
people
sick.
They
were
first
discovered
by
an
American
scientist
named
Dr.
Daniel
E.
Salmon
in
1885.
What
illness
do
people
get
from
Salmonella
infection?
Most
types
of
Salmonella
cause
an
illness
called
salmonellosis,
which
is
the
focus
of
this
website.
Some
other
types
of
Salmonella
cause
typhoid
fever
or
paratyphoid
fever.
What
are
the
symptoms
of
infection?
Most
people
with
Salmonella
infection
have
diarrhea,
fever,
and
stomach
cramps.
Symptoms
usually
begin
six
hours
to
six
days
after
infection
and
last
four
to
seven
days.
However,
some
people
do
not
develop
symptoms
for
several
weeks
after
infection
and
others
experience
symptoms
for
several
weeks.
Salmonella
strains
sometimes
cause
infection
in
urine,
blood,
bones,
joints,
or
the
nervous
system
(spinal
fluid
and
brain),
and
can
cause
severe
disease.
Salmonella
are
a
diverse
group
of
bacteria.Scientists
classify
Salmonella
into
serotypes
(types)
by
identifying
structures
on
the
bacteria’s
surfaces.
Although
more
than
2,500
serotypes
have
been
described,
fewer
than
100
are
known
to
cause
human
infections.

>How
is
Salmonella
infection
diagnosed?
Salmonella
infection
is
diagnosed
when
a
laboratory
test detects
Salmonella
bacteria
in
a
person’s
stool
(poop),
body
tissue,
or
fluids.
How
is
infection
treated?
Most
people
recover
from
Salmonella
infection
within
four
to
seven
days
without
antibiotics.
People
who
are
sick
with
a
Salmonella
infection
should
drink
extra
fluids
as
long
as
diarrhea
lasts.
Antibiotic
treatment
is
recommended
for:
People
with
severe
illness
People
with
a
weakened
immune
system,
such
as
from
HIV
infection
or
chemotherapy
treatment
Adults
older
than
50
who
have
medical
problems,
such
as
heart
disease
Infants
(children
younger
than
12
months).
Adults
age
65
or
older
Can
infection
cause
long-term
health
problems?
Most
people
with
diarrhea
caused
by
Salmonella
recover
completely,
although
some
people’s
bowel
habits
(frequency
and
consistency
of
poop)
may
not
return
to
normal
for
a
few
months.
Some
people
with
Salmonella
infection
develop
pain
in
their
joints,
called
reactive
arthritis,
after
the
infection
has
ended.
Reactive
arthritis
can
last
for
months
or
years
and
can
be
difficult
to
treat.
Some
people
with
reactive
arthritis
develop
irritation
of
the
eyes
and
pain
when
urinating.
How
do
people
get
infected?
Salmonella
live
in
the
intestines
of
people
and
animals.
People
can
get
Salmonella
infection
from
a
variety
of
sources,
including
Eating
contaminated
food
or
drinking
contaminated
water
Touching
infected
animals,
their
feces,
or
their
environment
Who
is
more
likely
to
get
an
infection
and
severe
illness?
Children
under
5
years
old
are
the
most
likely
to
get
a
Salmonella
infection.
Infants
(children
younger
than
12
months)
who
are
not
breast
fed
are
more
likely
to
get
a
Salmonella
infection.
Infants,
adults
aged
65
and
older,
and
people
with
a
weakened
immune
system
are
the
most
likely
to
have
severe
infections.
People
taking
certain
medicines
(for
example,
stomach
acid
reducers)
are
at
increased
risk
of
infection.
What
should
I
know
about
antibiotic
resistance
and
Salmonella?
Resistance
to
essential
antibiotics
is
increasing
in
Salmonella,
which
can
limit
treatment
options
for
people
with
severe
infections.
One
way
to
slow
down
the
development
of
antibiotic
resistance
is
by
appropriate
use
of
antibiotics.
What
can
be
done
to
prevent
antibiotic
resistance
and
resistant
bacteria?
Appropriate
use
of
antibiotics
in
people
and
animals
(use
only
when
needed
and
exactly
as
prescribed)
can
help
prevent
antibiotic
resistance
and
the
spread
of
resistant
bacteria.
How
common
is
Salmonella
infection?
CDC
estimates
Salmonella
cause
about
1.35
million
illnesses,
26,500
hospitalizations,
and
420
deaths
in
the
United
States
every
year.

What
are
Salmonella?
Salmonella
are
bacteria
that
make
people
sick.
They
were
first
discovered
by
an
American
scientist
named
Dr.
Daniel
E.
Salmon
in
1885.
What
illness
do
people
get
from
Salmonella
infection?
Most
types
of
Salmonella
cause
an
illness
called
salmonellosis,
which
is
the
focus
of
this
website.
Some
other
types
of
Salmonella
cause
typhoid
fever
or
paratyphoid
fever.
What
are
the
symptoms
of
infection?
Most
people
with
Salmonella
infection
have
diarrhea,
fever,
and
stomach
cramps.
Symptoms
usually
begin
six
hours
to
six
days
after
infection
and
last
four
to
seven
days.
However,
some
people
do
not
develop
symptoms
for
several
weeks
after
infection
and
others
experience
symptoms
for
several
weeks.
Salmonella
strains
sometimes
cause
infection
in
urine,
blood,
bones,
joints,
or
the
nervous
system
(spinal
fluid
and
brain),
and
can
cause
severe
disease.
Salmonella
are
a
diverse
group
of
bacteria.Scientists
classify
Salmonella
into
serotypes
(types)
by
identifying
structures
on
the
bacteria’s
surfaces.
Although
more
than
2,500
serotypes
have
been
described,
fewer
than
100
are
known
to
cause
human
infections.
More
>How
is
Salmonella
infection
diagnosed?
Salmonella
infection
is
diagnosed
when
a
laboratory
test detects
Salmonella
bacteria
in
a
person’s
stool
(poop),
body
tissue,
or
fluids.
How
is
infection
treated?
Most
people
recover
from
Salmonella
infection
within
four
to
seven
days
without
antibiotics.
People
who
are
sick
with
a
Salmonella
infection
should
drink
extra
fluids
as
long
as
diarrhea
lasts.
Antibiotic
treatment
is
recommended
for:
People
with
severe
illness
People
with
a
weakened
immune
system,
such
as
from
HIV
infection
or
chemotherapy
treatment
Adults
older
than
50
who
have
medical
problems,
such
as
heart
disease
Infants
(children
younger
than
12
months).
Adults
age
65
or
older
Can
infection
cause
long-term
health
problems?
Most
people
with
diarrhea
caused
by
Salmonella
recover
completely,
although
some
people’s
bowel
habits
(frequency
and
consistency
of
poop)
may
not
return
to
normal
for
a
few
months.
Some
people
with
Salmonella
infection
develop
pain
in
their
joints,
called
reactive
arthritis,
after
the
infection
has
ended.
Reactive
arthritis
can
last
for
months
or
years
and
can
be
difficult
to
treat.
Some
people
with
reactive
arthritis
develop
irritation
of
the
eyes
and
pain
when
urinating.
How
do
people
get
infected?
Salmonella
live
in
the
intestines
of
people
and
animals.
People
can
get
Salmonella
infection
from
a
variety
of
sources,
including
Eating
contaminated
food
or
drinking
contaminated
water
Touching
infected
animals,
their
feces,
or
their
environment
Who
is
more
likely
to
get
an
infection
and
severe
illness?
Children
under
5
years
old
are
the
most
likely
to
get
a
Salmonella
infection.
Infants
(children
younger
than
12
months)
who
are
not
breast
fed
are
more
likely
to
get
a
Salmonella
infection.
Infants,
adults
aged
65
and
older,
and
people
with
a
weakened
immune
system
are
the
most
likely
to
have
severe
infections.
People
taking
certain
medicines
(for
example,
stomach
acid
reducers)
are
at
increased
risk
of
infection.
What
should
I
know
about
antibiotic
resistance
and
Salmonella?
Resistance
to
essential
antibiotics
is
increasing
in
Salmonella,
which
can
limit
treatment
options
for
people
with
severe
infections.
One
way
to
slow
down
the
development
of
antibiotic
resistance
is
by
appropriate
use
of
antibiotics.
What
can
be
done
to
prevent
antibiotic
resistance
and
resistant
bacteria?
Appropriate
use
of
antibiotics
in
people
and
animals
(use
only
when
needed
and
exactly
as
prescribed)
can
help
prevent
antibiotic
resistance
and
the
spread
of
resistant
bacteria.
How
common
is
Salmonella
infection?
CDC
estimates
Salmonella
cause
about
1.35
million
illnesses,
26,500
hospitalizations,
and
420
deaths
in
the
United
States
every
year.

Overview
Modes
of
Transmission
Symptoms
Diagnosis
Treatment
Salmonella
septicemia
is
a
condition
wherein
the
presence
of
Salmonella
bacteria
in
the
blood
triggers
a
potentially
life-threatening,
whole-body
inflammatory
response.
Recurrent
Salmonella
septicemia
is
classified
as
an
AIDS-defining
condition
by
the
Centers
for
Disease
Control
and
Prevention
(CDC).
National
Institute
of
Allergies
and
Infectious
Diseases
(NIAID)
With
the
advent
of
combination
antiretroviral
therapy
(ART),
Salmonella
septicemia
is
considered
rare
among
people
living
with
HIV
in
the
developed
world,
with
one
study
showing
only
22
cases
out
of
9,000
patients
monitored
over
a
nine-year
period.
By
contrast,
invasive
non-typhoidal
Salmonella
has
emerged
as
a
major
public
health
problem
in
developing
countries,
particularly
sub-Saharan
Africa.
Overview
Salmonella
consist
of
a
large
family
of
bacterium
which
occur
normally
or
pathogenically
in
the
intestines
of
humans
and
other
animals.
Over
2,400
strains
of
Salmonella
have
been
identified.
What
differentiates
salmonellosis
(often
called
Salmonella
poisoning)
from
Salmonella
septicemia
is
that
salmonellosis
is
isolated
to
the
gastrointestinal
tract.
In
contrast,
with
Salmonella
septicemia,
bacterial
endotoxins
spread
from
the
intestines
into
the
bloodstream
and
then
to
other
body
sites,
the
pathogen
can
trigger
a
severe
immune
response.
If
left
untreated,
this
can
be
fatal.

Modes
of
Transmission
Salmonella
transmission
usually
occurs
through
the
fecal-oral
route.
Animals
can
become
infected
through
contaminated
feed,
water,
or
close
contact
with
an
infected
host.
The
bacteria
can
then
be
passed
to
humans
through
tainted
meat
or
animal
products
that
have
not
been
thoroughly
cooked.
Salmonella
can
also
be
transmitted
through
tainted
fruits
and
vegetables,
from
animals/pets
to
humans,
and
from
human
to
human
(rare).
Even
after
treatment,
humans
can
remain
infectious
for
months
after
recovery.
Proper
hygiene
(including
food
hygiene)
is
recommended,
particularly
for
those
with
CD4
counts
under
200
cells/μL.
Salmonella
Septicemia
Symptoms
In
addition
to
the
diarrhea,
vomiting,
and
abdominal
cramping
commonly
associated
with
salmonellosis,
symptoms
of
Salmonella
septicemia
can
include:
High
feversChillsSwellingFlushed
skinIncreased
heart
rateConfusionHyperventilationHigh
blood
pressure
Diagnosis
Salmonella
septicemia
is
confirmed
with
a
blood
test,
supplemented
by
a
stool
culture.
Treatment
For
HIV-positive
patients
with
severe
Salmonella
septicemia,
a
broad-spectrum
antibiotic
would
be
administered
intravenously,
immediately
upon
diagnosis.
Cipro
(ciprofloxacin),
a
fluoroquinolone-class
antibiotic,
is
generally
recommended.
In
the
event
of
fluoroquinolone
resistance,
cephalosporins
are
also
known
to
be
effective.
Treatment
duration
can
last
anywhere
from
seven
to
10
days,
depending
on
severity.
Intravenous
fluids
would
be
administered
to
address
any
fluid
deficits.
Maintenance
therapy
should
continue
for
six
to
eight
months
after
completion
of
treatment.
With
the
implementation
of
ART,
the
risk
of
recurrence
is
significantly
reduced.

CDC
estimates
Salmonella
bacteria
cause
about
1.35
million
infections,
26,500
hospitalizations,
and
420
deaths
in
the
United
States
every
year.
Food
is
the
source
for
most
of
these
illnesses.
Most
people
who
get
ill
from
Salmonella
have
diarrhea,
fever,
and
stomach
cramps.
Symptoms
usually
begin
6
hours
to
6
days
after
infection
and
last
4
to
7
days.
Most
people
recover
without
specific
treatment
and
should
not
take
antibiotics.
Antibiotics
are
typically
used
only
to
treat
people
who
have
severe
illness
or
who
are
at
risk
for
it.
Some
people’s
illness
may
be
so
severe
that
they
need
to
be
hospitalized.

What
are
salmonella
infections?
Salmonella
is
caused
by
the
bacteria
salmonella.
Salmonella
is
a
group
of
bacteria
that
can
cause
diarrhea
in
humans.
There
are
many
different
kinds
of
salmonella
bacteria.
What
causes
salmonella
infections?
Salmonella
infection
is
caused
by
a
group
of
salmonella
bacteria
called
Salmonella.
The
bacteria
are
passed
from
feces
of
people
or
animals
to
other
people
or
animals.
Contaminated
foods
are
often
animal
in
origin.
They
include
beef,
poultry,
seafood,
milk,
or
eggs.
However,
all
foods,
including
some
unwashed
fruits
and
vegetables
can
become
contaminated.
Salmonella
typhi
is
the
one
type
of
salmonella
that
lives
only
in
humans.
It
is
passed
only
from
human
to
human
through
contaminated
food
or
water.
It
tends
to
cause
a
serious
and
life-threatening
infection
called
typhoid
fever.
Treatment
often
needs
antibiotics.
A
small
number
of
people
who
are
treated
may
feel
better
after
treatment,
but
will
continue
to
carry
the
organism
and
pass
it
through
their
feces
to
others
through
contaminated
food
or
water.
Who
is
at
risk
for
salmonella
infections?
Certain
factors
can
increase
your
risk
for
getting
salmonella.
These
factors
include:
Eating
raw
or
undercooked
eggs,
poultry,
and
beef,
or
unwashed
fresh
fruits
and
vegetables,
including
raw
alfalfa
sprouts
Handling
animals
or
pets,
such
as
turtles,
snakes,
and
lizards
What
are
the
symptoms
of
salmonella
infections?
The
following
are
the
most
common
symptoms
of
salmonella.
However,
each
person
may
experience
symptoms
differently.
Symptoms
develop
12
to
72
hours
after
infection
and
may
include:
Diarrhea
Fever
Abdominal
cramps
Chills
Headache
Nausea
or
vomiting
The
symptoms
of
salmonella
infections
may
look
like
other
conditions
or
medical
problems.
Always
talk
with
your
healthcare
provider
for
a
diagnosis.
How
are
salmonella
infections
diagnosed?
Since
many
different
illnesses
have
symptoms
similar
to
salmonella,
diagnosis
depends
on
lab
tests
that
identify
salmonella
in
your
stool.
How
are
salmonella
infections
treated?
Your
healthcare
provider
will
figure
out
the
best
treatment
for
you
based
on:
How
old
you
are
Your
overall
health
and
past
health
How
sick
you
are
How
well
you
can
handle
specific
medicines,
procedures,
or
therapies
How
long
the
condition
is
expected
to
last
Your
opinion
or
preference
These
infections
generally
run
their
course
in
4
to
7
days.
Often
no
treatment
is
needed.
However,
if
you
have
severe
diarrhea,
you
may
need
rehydration
with
intravenous
(IV)
fluids.
If
the
infection
spreads
from
the
intestines
to
the
blood
stream,
prompt
treatment
with
antibiotics
will
be
necessary.
What
are
the
complications
of
salmonella
infections?
Most
people
recover
completely
from
a
salmonella
infection.
Some
people
may
develop
a
condition
called
reactive
arthritis
also
known
as
Reiter’s
syndrome
weeks
or
even
months
later.
This
causes
joint
pain,
eye
irritation,
and
painful
urination.
Can
salmonella
infections
be
prevented?
Since
foods
of
animal
origin
pose
the
greatest
threat
of
salmonella
contamination,
do
not
eat
raw
or
undercooked
eggs,
poultry,
seafood,
or
meats.
Remember
that
some
sauces
and
desserts
use
raw
eggs
in
their
preparation,
so
be
cautious
of
these,
particularly
in
foreign
countries.
Also,
follow
these
recommendations
by
the
CDC:
Make
sure
all
poultry,
meats,
seafood,
and
eggs,
are
well-cooked.
Cook
food
containing
any
of
these
ingredients
to
an
internal
temperature
of
165°
F
(73.8°
C).
Do
not
consume
raw
or
unpasteurized
milk
or
other
dairy
products.
Do
not
consume
raw
or
undercooked
eggs.
Discard
cracked
eggs.
Keep
eggs
refrigerated.
Thoroughly
wash
produce
before
eating
it.
Avoid
cross-contamination
of
foods.
Keep
uncooked
meats
separate
from
produce,
cooked
foods,
and
ready-to-eat
foods.
Thoroughly
wash
all
utensils,
including
cutting
boards,
knives,
and
counters,
after
handling
uncooked
foods.
Thoroughly
wash
hands
before
handling
foods
and
between
handling
different
food
items.
Thoroughly
wash
hands
after
contact
with
feces.
Thoroughly
wash
hands
after
handling
any
reptiles
or
birds,
since
reptiles
and
birds
are
particularly
likely
to
carry
salmonella.
When
should
I
call
my
healthcare
provider?
If
your
symptoms
get
worse
or
you
get
new
symptoms,
let
your
healthcare
provider
know.
If
your
diarrhea
continues
more
than
a
few
days
or
gets
worse,
you
may
get
dehydrated
and
need
IV
fluids.
Key
points
about
salmonella
infections
Salmonella
infections
are
diarrheal
infections
caused
by
the
bacteria
salmonella.
Symptoms
of
a
salmonella
infection
may
include
diarrhea,
fever,
abdominal
cramps
12
to
72
hours
after
infection
chills,
headache,
nausea,
or
vomiting.
Treatment
may
not
be
necessary
unless
dehydration
happens
or
the
infection
spreads
to
the
blood
stream.
Prevention
includes
cooking
foods
properly,
avoiding
raw
milk
and
eggs,
washing
food,
utensils,
hands,
and
kitchen
surfaces
properly.

Salmonellosis
is
a
symptomatic
infection
caused
by
bacteria
of
the
Salmonella
type.[1]
It
is
also
a
food-borne
disease
and
are
defined
as
diseases,
usually
either
infectious
or
toxic
in
nature,
caused
by
agents
that
enter
the
body
through
the
ingestion
of
food.
In
humans,
the
most
common
symptoms
are
diarrhea,
fever,
abdominal
cramps,
and
vomiting.[1]
Symptoms
typically
occur
between
12
hours
and
36
hours
after
exposure,
and
last
from
two
to
seven
days.[4]
Occasionally
more
significant
disease
can
result
in
dehydration.[4]
The
old,
young,
and
others
with
a
weakened
immune
system
are
more
likely
to
develop
severe
disease.[1]
Specific
types
of
Salmonella
can
result
in
typhoid
fever
or
paratyphoid
fever.[1][3]
There
are
two
species
of
Salmonella:
Salmonella
bongori
and
Salmonella
enterica
with
many
subspecies.[4]
However,
subgroups
and
serovars
within
a
species
may
be
substantially
different
in
their
ability
to
cause
disease.
This
suggests
that
epidemiologic
classification
of
organisms
at
the
subspecies
level
may
improve
management
of
Salmonella
and
similar
pathogens.[6][7][8]
Both
vegetarian
and
non-vegetarian
populations
are
susceptible
to
Salmonella
infections
due
to
the
consumption
of
contaminated
meat
and
milk.[9]
Infection
is
usually
spread
by
eating
contaminated
meat,
eggs,
water
or
milk.[10]
Other
foods
may
spread
the
disease
if
they
have
come
into
contact
with
manure.[4]
A
number
of
pets
including
cats,
dogs,
and
reptiles
can
also
carry
and
spread
the
infection.[4]
Diagnosis
is
by
a
stool
test
or
blood
tests.[1][3]
Efforts
to
prevent
the
disease
include
the
proper
washing,
preparation,
and
cooking
of
food
to
appropriate
temperature.[4]
Mild
disease
typically
does
not
require
specific
treatment.[4]
More
significant
cases
may
require
treatment
of
electrolyte
problems
and
intravenous
fluid
replacement.[1][4]
In
those
at
high
risk
or
in
whom
the
disease
has
spread
outside
the
intestines,
antibiotics
are
recommended.[4]
Salmonellosis
is
one
of
the
most
common
causes
of
diarrhea
globally.[2]
In
2015,
90,300
deaths
occurred
from
nontyphoidal
salmonellosis,
and
178,000
deaths
from
typhoidal
salmonellosis.[5]
In
the
United
States,
about
1.2
million
cases
and
450
deaths
occur
from
nontyphoidal
salmonellosis
a
year.[1]
In
Europe,
it
is
the
second
most
common
foodborne
disease
after
campylobacteriosis.[2]

Signs
and
symptoms[edit]
Enteritis[edit]
See
also:
Enteritis
§ Infectious
enteritis
After
a
short
incubation
period
of
a
few
hours
to
one
day,
the
bacteria
multiply
in
the
small
intestine,
causing
an
intestinal
inflammation
(enteritis).
Most
people
with
salmonellosis
develop
diarrhea,
fever,
vomiting,
and
abdominal
cramps
12
to
72
hours
after
infection.[11]
Diarrhea
is
often
watery
and
non-bloody
but
may
be
mucoid
and
bloody.[12]
In
most
cases,
the
illness
lasts
four
to
seven
days,
and
does
not
require
treatment.
In
some
cases,
though,
the
diarrhea
may
be
so
severe
that
the
patient
becomes
dangerously
dehydrated
and
must
be
hospitalized.
At
the
hospital,
the
patient
may
receive
fluids
intravenously
to
treat
the
dehydration,
and
may
be
given
medications
to
provide
symptomatic
relief,
such
as
fever
reduction.
In
severe
cases,
the
Salmonella
infection
may
spread
from
the
intestines
to
the
blood
stream,
and
then
to
other
body
sites,
and
can
cause
death,
unless
the
person
is
treated
promptly
with
antibiotics.[citation
needed]
In
otherwise
healthy
adults,
the
symptoms
can
be
mild.
Normally,
no
sepsis
occurs,
but
it
can
occur
exceptionally
as
a
complication
in
the
immunocompromised.
However,
in
people
at
risk
such
as
infants,
small
children,
and
the
elderly,
Salmonella
infections
can
become
very
serious,
leading
to
complications.
In
infants,
dehydration
can
cause
a
state
of
severe
toxicity.
Extraintestinal
localizations
are
possible,
especially
Salmonella
meningitis
in
children,
osteitis,
etc.
Children
with
sickle-cell
anemia
who
are
infected
with
Salmonella
may
develop
osteomyelitis.
Treatment
of
osteomyelitis,
in
this
case,
will
be
to
use
fluoroquinolones
(ciprofloxacin,
levofloxacin,
etc.,
and
nalidixic
acid).[citation
needed]
Those
whose
only
symptom
is
diarrhea
usually
completely
recover,
but
their
bowel
habits
may
not
return
to
normal
for
several
months.[13]
Typhoid
fever[edit]
See
also:
Typhoid
fever
and
Paratyphoid
fever
Typhoid
fever
occurs
when
Salmonella
bacteria
enter
the
lymphatic
system
and
cause
a
systemic
form
of
salmonellosis.
Endotoxins
first
act
on
the
vascular
and
nervous
apparatus,
resulting
in
increased
permeability
and
decreased
tone
of
the
vessels,
upset
thermal
regulation,
vomiting,
and
diarrhea.
In
severe
forms
of
the
disease,
enough
liquid
and
electrolytes
are
lost
to
upset
the
fluid
balance,
cause
an
electrolyte
imbalance,
decrease
the
circulating
blood
volume
and
arterial
pressure,
and
cause
hypovolemic
shock.
Septic
shock
may
also
develop.
Shock
of
mixed
character
(with
signs
of
both
hypovolemic
and
septic
shock)
are
more
common
in
severe
salmonellosis.
Oliguria
and
azotemia
develop
in
severe
cases
as
a
result
of
renal
involvement
due
to
hypoxia
and
toxemia.[11]
Long-term[edit]
Salmonellosis
is
associated
with
later
irritable
bowel
syndrome[14]
and
inflammatory
bowel
disease.[15]
Evidence
however
does
not
support
it
being
a
direct
cause
of
the
latter.[15]
A
small
number
of
people
afflicted
with
salmonellosis
experience
reactive
arthritis,
which
can
last
months
or
years
and
can
lead
to
chronic
arthritis.[16]
In
sickle-cell
anemia,
osteomyelitis
due
to
Salmonella
infection
is
much
more
common
than
in
the
general
population.
Though
Salmonella
infection
is
frequently
the
cause
of
osteomyelitis
in
people
with
sickle-cell,
it
is
not
the
most
common
cause,
which
is
Staphylococcus
infection.[17]
Those
infected
may
become
asymptomatic
carriers,
but
this
is
relatively
uncommon,
with
shedding
observed
in
only
0.2
to
0.6%
of
cases
after
a
year.[18]

turtles)
is
well
described.[22]
Amphibians
such
as

Salmonella
bacteria
can
survive
for
some
time
without
a
host;
they
are
frequently
found
in
polluted
water,
with
contamination
from
the
excrement
of
carrier
animals
being
particularly
important.[citation
needed]
The
European
Food
Safety
Authority
highly
recommends
that
when
handling
raw
turkey
meat,
consumers
and
people
involved
in
the
food
supply
chain
should
pay
attention
to
personal
and
food
hygiene.[23]
An
estimated
142,000
Americans
are
infected
each
year
with
Salmonella
Enteritidis
from
chicken
eggs,[24]
and
about
30
die.[25]
The
shell
of
the
egg
may
be
contaminated
with
Salmonella
by
feces
or
environment,
or
its
interior
(yolk)
may
be
contaminated
by
penetration
of
the
bacteria
through
the
porous
shell
or
from
a
hen
whose
infected
ovaries
contaminate
the
egg
during
egg
formation.[26][27]
Nevertheless,
such
interior
egg
yolk
contamination
is
theoretically
unlikely.[28][29][30][31]
Even
under
natural
conditions,
the
rate
of
infection
was
very
small
(0.6%
in
a
study
of
naturally
contaminated
eggs[32]
and
3.0%
among
artificially
and
heavily
infected
hens[33]).
Prevention[edit]
See
also:
Critical
control
point
The
US
Food
and
Drug
Administration
(FDA)
has
published
guidelines
to
help
reduce
the
chance
of
food-borne
salmonellosis.[34]
Food
must
be
cooked
to
145–165 °F
(63–74 °C),
and
liquids
such
as
soups
or
gravies
should
be
boiled
when
reheating.
Freezing
kills
some
Salmonella,
but
it
is
not
sufficient
to
reliably
reduce
them
below
infectious
levels.
While
Salmonella
is
usually
heat-sensitive,
it
acquires
heat-resistance
in
high-fat
environments
such
as
peanut
butter.[35]
Vaccine[edit]
Antibodies
against
nontyphoidal
Salmonella
were
first
found
in
Malawi
children
in
research
published
in
2008.
The
Malawian
researchers
identified
an
antibody
that
protects
children
against
bacterial
infections
of
the
blood
caused
by
nontyphoidal
Salmonella.
A
study
at
Queen
Elizabeth
Hospital
in
Blantyre
found
that
children
up
to
two
years
old
develop
antibodies
that
aid
in
killing
the
bacteria.
This
could
lead
to
a
possible
Salmonella
vaccine
for
humans.[36]
A
2014
study
tested
a
vaccine
on
chickens
which
offered
efficient
protection
against
salmonellosis.[37]
Vaccination
of
chickens
against
Salmonella
essentially
wiped
out
the
disease
in
the
United
Kingdom.
A
similar
approach
was
considered
in
the
United
States,
but
the
Food
and
Drug
Administration
decided
not
to
mandate
vaccination
of
hens.[38]
Industrial
hygiene[edit]
Since
2011,
Denmark
has
had
three
cases
of
human
salmonella
poisoning.[39]
The
country
eradicated
salmonella
without
vaccines
and
antibiotics
by
focusing
on
eliminating
the
infection
from
""breeder
stocks"",
implementing
various
measures
to
prevent
infection,
and
taking
a
zero-tolerance
policy
towards
salmonella
in
chickens.[39]
Treatment[edit]
Electrolytes
may
be
replenished
with
oral
rehydration
supplements
(typically
containing
salts
sodium
chloride
and
potassium
chloride).[citation
needed]
Appropriate
antibiotics,
such
as
ceftriaxone,
may
be
given
to
kill
the
bacteria,
but
are
not
necessary
in
most
cases.[18]
Azithromycin
has
been
suggested
to
be
better
at
treating
typhoid
in
resistant
populations
than
both
fluoroquinolone
drugs
and
ceftriaxone.
There
are
recommendations
on
choice
of
antibiotic
to
avoid
promoting
antibiotic
resistance.[citation
needed]
There
is
no
evidence
of
benefit
of
treating
healthy
people
with
diarrhea
due
to
non-typhoidal
salmonellosis.
However,
the
evidence
for
the
very
young,
very
old
or
people
with
severe
diseases
are
uncertain.[40]

every
year.[41]
About
142,000
people
in
the
United
States
are
infected
each
year
with
Salmonella
Enteritidis
specifically
from
chicken
eggs,
and
about
30
die.[25]
In
2010,
an
analysis
of
death
certificates
in
the
United
States
identified
a
total
of
1,316
Salmonella-related
deaths
from
1990
to
2006.
These
were
predominantly
among
older
adults
and
those
who
were
immunocompromised.[42]
The
U.S.
government
reported
as
many
as
20%
of
all
chickens
were
contaminated
with
Salmonella
in
the
late
1990s,
and
16.3%
were
contaminated
in
2005.[43]
The
United
States
has
struggled
to
control
salmonella
infections,
with
the
rate
of
infection
rising
from
2001
to
2011.
In
1998,
the
USDA
moved
to
close
plants
if
salmonella
was
found
in
excess
of
20
percent,
which
was
the
industry's
average
at
the
time,
for
three
consecutive
tests.[44]
Texas-based
Supreme
Beef
Processors,
Inc.
sued
on
the
argument
that
Salmonella
is
naturally
occurring
and
ultimately
prevailed
when
a
federal
appeals
court
affirmed
a
lower
court.[44]
These
issues
were
highlighted
in
a
proposed
Kevin's
Law
(formally
proposed
as
the
Meat
and
Poultry
Pathogen
Reduction
and
Enforcement
Act
of
2003),
of
which
components
were
included
the
Food
Safety
Modernization
Act
passed
in
2011,
but
that
law
applies
only
to
the
FDA
and
not
the
USDA.[44]
The
USDA
proposed
a
regulatory
initiative
in
2011
to
Office
of
Management
and
Budget.[45]
Salmonella
is
found
in
8%
of
the
chicken
parts
tested
by
the
USDA
and
25%
of
ground
chicken.[46]
Europe[edit]
An
outbreak
of
salmonellosis
started
in
Northern
Europe
in
July
2012,
caused
by
Salmonella
thompson.
The
infections
were
linked
to
smoked
salmon
from
the
manufacturer
Foppen,
where
the
contamination
had
occurred.
Most
infections
were
reported
in
the
Netherlands;
over
1060
infections
with
this
subspecies
and
four
fatalities
were
confirmed.[47][48]
A
case
of
widespread
infection
was
detected
mid-2012
in
seven
EU
countries.
Over
400
people
had
been
infected
with
Salmonella
enterica
serovar
Stanley
(S.
Stanley)
that
usually
appears
in
the
regions
of
Southeast
Asia.
After
several
DNA
analyses
seemed
to
point
to
a
specific
Belgian
strain,
the
""Joint
ECDC/E
FSA
Rapid
Risk
Assessment""
report
detected
turkey
production
as
the
source
of
infection.[49]
In
Germany,
food
poisoning
infections
must
be
reported.[50]
Between
1990
and
2005,
the
number
of
officially
recorded
cases
decreased
from
about
200,000
to
about
50,000.[citation
needed]
Elsewhere[edit]
In
March
2007,
around
150
people
were
diagnosed
with
salmonellosis
after
eating
tainted
food
at
a
governor's
reception
in
Krasnoyarsk,
Russia.
Over
1,500
people
attended
the
ball
on
March
1
and
fell
ill
as
a
consequence
of
ingesting
Salmonella-tainted
sandwiches.[citation
needed]
About
150
people
were
sickened
by
Salmonella-tainted
chocolate
cake
produced
by
a
major
bakery
chain
in
Singapore
in
December
2007.[51]
South
Africa
reported
contamination
of
its
poultry
carcasses
by
Salmonella.
Egypt
showed
that
Salmonella
was
predominant
in
poultry
along
with
other
non-typhoid
strains.
In
Indonesia,
the
isolation
of
Salmonella
Typhi
was
the
main
focus,
while
other
serovars
were
also
included
from
poultry.
In
India,
Salmonella
was
predominant
in
poultry.
Romania
reported
Salmonella
serovars
in
poultry
that
affect
humans.
[52]
History[edit]
Both
salmonellosis
and
the
microorganism
genus
Salmonella
derive
their
names
from
a
modern
Latin
coining
after
Daniel
E.
Salmon
(1850–1914),
an
American
veterinary
surgeon.
He
had
help
from
Theobald
Smith,
and
together
they
found
the
bacterium
in
pigs.[citation
needed]
Salmonella
enterica
was
possibly
the
cause
of
the
1576
cocliztli
epidemic
in
New
Spain.[53]
Four-inch
regulation[edit]
The
""Four-inch
regulation""
or
""Four-inch
law""
is
a
colloquial
name
for
a
regulation
issued
by
the
U.S.
FDA
in
1975,
restricting
the
sale
of
turtles
with
a
carapace
length
less
than
four
inches
(10 cm).[54]
The
regulation
was
introduced,
according
to
the
FDA,
""because
of
the
public
health
impact
of
turtle-associated
salmonellosis"".
Cases
had
been
reported
of
young
children
placing
small
turtles
in
their
mouths,
which
led
to
the
size-based
restriction.[citation
needed]
Regulation
elsewhere[edit]
FSSAI
regulation[edit]
The
FSSAI
has
been
established
under
the
Food
Safety
and
Standards
Act,
2006,
which
is
a
consolidating
statute
related
to
food
safety
and
regulation
in
India.
FSSAI
is
responsible
for
protecting
and
promoting
public
health
through
the
regulation
and
supervision
of
food
safety.
The
major
importance
of
the
FSSAI
License
is
that
it
ensures
that
the
food
is
verified
chemically
and
hence
is
safe
to
consume.
'Health
before
wealth'
is
a
common
quote
as
well
as
fact.
Therefore,
anything
related
directly
to
health
is
a
matter
of
great
sensitivity.[55]

Salmonella

can
contaminate
the

intact

eggs
as
a
result
of
infections
of
the
reproductive
tissue
of

The

site

infection

be
the

In

the
most

sites
are

In

As
albumen
is
an
iron-restricted
environment,
growth
only
occurs
with

changes
to
vitelline

permeability,
which
allows
salmonellae
to
invade
yolk
contents.

The
migration
of
the
bacterium
into
the
nutritionally
rich
yolk
is
constrained
by
the
lysozyme
loaded
vitelline
membrane,
and
would
need
warm
enough
storage
conditions
within
days
and
weeks.
The
high
concentration
on
of
antibodies
of
the
yolk
does
not
inhibit
the
Salmonella
multiplication.
Only
seldom
does
transovarian
contamination
of
the
developing
eggs
with
S.
enteritidis
make
this
bacterium
occur
in
laid
eggs,
because
of
the
bactericidal
efficacy
of
the
antimicrobial
peptides

Over
5700
hens
eggs
from
15
flocks
naturally
infected
with
Salmonella
enteritidis
were
examined
individually
for
the
presence
of

Thirty-two

experimentally
infected
with
large
oral
doses
of
Salmonella
Heidelberg,
Salmonella
Enteritidis

People
who
are
sick
from
Shigella
infection
usually
start

include:
Diarrhea
(sometimes
bloody)
Fever
Stomach
pain
Feeling
the
need
to
pass
stool
[poop]
even
when
the
bowels
are
empty
Some
people
with
shigellosis
will
not
have
any
symptoms.
Symptoms
usually
last
5
to
7
days,
but
some
people
may
experience
symptoms
anywhere
from
a
few
days
to
4
or
more
weeks.
In
some
cases,
it
may
take
several
months
before
bowel
habits
(for
example,
how
often
someone
passes
stool
and
the
consistency
of
their
stool)
are
entirely
normal.
When
to
Contact
Your

they
have
any
of
these
symptoms:
Fever
Bloody
diarrhea
Severe
stomach
cramping
or
tenderness
Dehydrated
Feel

who
are
in
poor
health
or
who
have
immune
systems
weakened
from
diseases
(such
as
HIV
or
chemotherapy
for
cancer)
are
more
likely
to
get
sick
for
a
longer
period
of
time.
Contact
your
healthcare
provider
if
you
are
in
one
of
these
groups

Rare
Symptoms
from
Shigella
Infections
Post-infectious
arthritis
About
2%
1-4 of
people
who
are
infected
with
the
type
of
Shigella
called
Shigella
flexneri
will
experience
post-infectious
arthritis,
which
causes
joint
pains,
eye
irritation,
and
painful
urination.
The
syndrome
only
occurs
in
people
who
have
specific
genetic
makeup
that
puts
them
at
risk
1,5-7.
It
can
last
for
months
or
years,
and
can
lead
to
chronic
arthritis.
Post-infectious
arthritis
usually
does
not
occur
in
people
who
get
sick
from
the
other
types
of
Shigella,
called
S.

Seizures
A
few
young
children
with
shigellosis
have
had
generalized
seizures,
but
the
seizures
usually
go
away
without
treatment.
Children
with
shigellosis
who
experience
seizures
typically
have
a
high
fever
or
abnormal
blood
electrolytes
(salts).
However,
healthcare
professionals
do
not
know
why
the
seizures
occur
1,2-6.

Seizures
A
few
young
children
with
shigellosis
have
had
generalized
seizures,
but
the
seizures
usually
go
away
without
treatment.
Children
with
shigellosis
who
experience
seizures
typically
have
a
high
fever
or
abnormal
blood
electrolytes
(salts).
However,
healthcare
professionals
do
not
know
why
the
seizures
occur
1,2-6.

minus
Related
Pages
People
who
are
sick
from
Shigella
infection
usually
start
experiencing
symptoms
1
to
2
days
after
contact
with
the
germ.
Symptoms
of
shigellosis
include:
Diarrhea
(sometimes
bloody)
Fever
Stomach
pain
Feeling
the
need
to
pass
stool
[poop]
even
when
the
bowels
are
empty
Some
people
with
shigellosis
will
not
have
any
symptoms.
Symptoms
usually
last
5
to
7
days,
but
some
people
may
experience
symptoms
anywhere
from
a
few
days
to
4
or
more
weeks.
In
some
cases,
it
may
take
several
months
before
bowel
habits
(for
example,
how
often
someone
passes
stool
and
the
consistency
of
their
stool)
are
entirely
normal.
When
to
Contact
Your
Doctor
People
with
diarrhea
should
contact
their
healthcare
provider
if
they
have
any
of
these
symptoms:
Fever
Bloody
diarrhea
Severe
stomach
cramping
or
tenderness
Dehydrated
Feel
very
sick
People
who
are
in
poor
health
or
who
have
immune
systems
weakened
from
diseases
(such
as
HIV
or
chemotherapy
for
cancer)
are
more
likely
to
get
sick
for
a
longer
period
of
time.
Contact
your
healthcare
provider
if
you
are
in
one
of
these
groups
and
have
symptoms
of
shigellosis.

Rare
Symptoms
from
Shigella
Infections
Post-infectious
arthritis
About
2%
1-4 of
people
who
are
infected
with
the
type
of
Shigella
called
Shigella
flexneri
will
experience
post-infectious
arthritis,
which
causes
joint
pains,
eye
irritation,
and
painful
urination.
The
syndrome
only
occurs
in
people
who
have
specific
genetic
makeup
that
puts
them
at
risk
1,5-7.
It
can
last
for
months
or
years,
and
can
lead
to
chronic
arthritis.
Post-infectious
arthritis
usually
does
not
occur
in
people
who
get
sick
from
the
other
types
of
Shigella,
called
S.
sonnei
8,9, S.
boydii,
or
S.
dystenteriae
10.

People
who
are
sick
from
Shigella
infection
usually
start
experiencing
symptoms
1
to
2
days
after
contact
with
the
germ.
Symptoms
of
shigellosis
include:
Diarrhea
(sometimes
bloody)
Fever
Stomach
pain
Feeling
the
need
to
pass
stool
[poop]
even
when
the
bowels
are
empty
Some
people
with
shigellosis
will
not
have
any
symptoms.
Symptoms
usually
last
5
to
7
days,
but
some
people
may
experience
symptoms
anywhere
from
a
few
days
to
4
or
more
weeks.
In
some
cases,
it
may
take
several
months
before
bowel
habits
(for
example,
how
often
someone
passes
stool
and
the
consistency
of
their
stool)
are
entirely
normal.
When
to
Contact
Your
Doctor
People
with
diarrhea
should
contact
their
healthcare
provider
if
they
have
any
of
these
symptoms:
Fever
Bloody
diarrhea
Severe
stomach
cramping
or
tenderness
Dehydrated
Feel
very
sick
People
who
are
in
poor
health
or
who
have
immune
systems
weakened
from
diseases
(such
as
HIV
or
chemotherapy
for
cancer)
are
more
likely
to
get
sick
for
a
longer
period
of
time.
Contact
your
healthcare
provider
if
you
are
in
one
of
these
groups

Rare
Symptoms
from
Shigella
Infections
Post-infectious
arthritis
About
2%
1-4 of
people
who
are
infected
with
the
type
of
Shigella
called
Shigella
flexneri
will
experience
post-infectious
arthritis,
which
causes
joint
pains,
eye
irritation,
and
painful
urination.
The
syndrome
only
occurs
in
people
who
have
specific
genetic
makeup
that
puts
them
at
risk
1,5-7.
It
can
last
for
months
or
years,
and
can
lead
to
chronic
arthritis.
Post-infectious
arthritis
usually
does
not
occur
in
people
who
get
sick
from
the
other
types
of
Shigella,
called
S.

Seizures
A
few
young
children
with
shigellosis
have
had
generalized
seizures,
but
the
seizures
usually
go
away
without
treatment.
Children
with
shigellosis
who
experience
seizures
typically
have
a
high
fever
or
abnormal
blood
electrolytes
(salts).
However,
healthcare
professionals
do
not
know
why
the
seizures
occur

Symptoms
minus
Related
Pages
People
who
are
sick
from
Shigella
infection
usually
start
experiencing
symptoms
1
to
2
days
after
contact
with
the
germ.
Symptoms
of
shigellosis
include:
Diarrhea
(sometimes
bloody)
Fever
Stomach
pain
Feeling
the
need
to
pass
stool
[poop]
even
when
the
bowels
are
empty
Some
people
with
shigellosis
will
not
have
any
symptoms.
Symptoms
usually
last
5
to
7
days,
but
some
people
may
experience
symptoms
anywhere
from
a
few
days
to
4
or
more
weeks.
In
some
cases,
it
may
take
several
months
before
bowel
habits
(for
example,
how
often
someone
passes
stool
and
the
consistency
of
their
stool)
are
entirely
normal.
When
to
Contact
Your
Doctor
People
with
diarrhea
should
contact
their
healthcare
provider
if
they
have
any
of
these
symptoms:
Fever
Bloody
diarrhea
Severe
stomach
cramping
or
tenderness
Dehydrated
Feel
very
sick
People
who
are
in
poor
health
or
who
have
immune
systems
weakened
from
diseases
(such
as
HIV
or
chemotherapy
for
cancer)
are
more
likely
to
get
sick
for
a
longer
period
of
time.
Contact
your
healthcare
provider
if
you
are
in
one
of
these
groups
and
have
symptoms
of
shigellosis.

Rare
Symptoms
from
Shigella
Infections
Post-infectious
arthritis
About
2%
1-4 of
people
who
are
infected
with
the
type
of
Shigella
called
Shigella
flexneri
will
experience
post-infectious
arthritis,
which
causes
joint
pains,
eye
irritation,
and
painful
urination.
The
syndrome
only
occurs
in
people
who
have
specific
genetic
makeup
that
puts
them
at
risk
1,5-7.
It
can
last
for
months
or
years,
and
can
lead
to
chronic
arthritis.
Post-infectious
arthritis
usually
does
not
occur
in
people
who
get
sick
from
the
other
types
of
Shigella,
called
S.
sonnei
8,9, S.
boydii,
or
S.
dystenteriae
10.

CDC's
new
Shigella
Prevention
and
Control
Toolkit
Shigella
bacteria
cause
an
infection
called
shigellosis.
Most
people
with
Shigella
infection
have
diarrhea
(sometimes
bloody),
fever,
and
stomach
cramps.
Symptoms
usually
begin
1–2
days
after
infection
and
last
7
days.
Most
people
recover
without
needing
antibiotics.
However,
people
with
severe
illness
and
those
with
underlying
conditions
that
weaken
the
immune
system
should
be
given
antibiotics.
Antibiotics
can
shorten
the
duration
of
illness
(by
about
2
days)
and
might
help
reduce
the
spread
of
Shigella
to
others.
Washing
your
hands
often
with
soap
and
running
water
and
taking
other
hygiene
measures can
help
protect
you
and
your
loved
ones
from
infection.

What
is
bacterial
gastroenteritis?
Gastroenteritis
is
inflammation
of
the
stomach
and
intestines.
It
can
cause
symptoms
ranging
from
mild
to
severe.
A
virus,
bacterium,
or
parasite can
cause
gastroenteritis.
When
it’s
caused
by
a
type
of
bacteria,
it’s
called
bacterial
gastroenteritis.
Gastroenteritis
is
very
common.
Bacterial
gastroenteritis
is
less
common
than
viral
gastroenteritis.
But
it’s
still
a
major
health
risk.
This
is
because
you
can
get
dehydrated
from
vomiting
or
diarrhea.
What
causes
bacterial
gastroenteritis?
The
more
common
types
of
bacteria
that
can
cause
gastroenteritis
include:
E.
coli
Salmonella
Campylobacter
Shigella
What
are
the
symptoms
of
bacterial
gastroenteritis?
Symptoms
can
range
from
mild
pain
to
life-threatening. Each
person
may
experience
symptoms
differently.
Symptoms
may
include:
Nausea
Vomiting
Fever
(sometimes
very
high)
Belly
(abdominal)
cramping
and
pain
Diarrhea,
possibly
bloody
Dehydration
Electrolyte
imbalance
These
symptoms
can
happen
with
all
forms
of
gastroenteritis
(both
viral
and
bacterial). High
fever
and
bloody
diarrhea
are
more
common
with
bacterial
gastroenteritis.
Untreated
severe
bacterial
gastroenteritis
can
lead
to
severe
dehydration,
nerve
problems,
kidney
failure,
and
even
death.
The
symptoms
of
bacterial
gastroenteritis
may
look
like
other
health
problems.
Always
talk
with
your
healthcare
provider
for
a
diagnosis.
How
is
bacterial
gastroenteritis
diagnosed?
Your
healthcare
provider
will
do
an
exam
and
ask
about
your
health
history. Your
healthcare
provider
will
likely
ask
for
a
stool
sample
to
find
the
source
of
your
illness
and
whether
it’s
bacterial
or
viral.
You
may
need
blood
tests
to
find
out
how
severe
the
illness
is.
How
is
bacterial
gastroenteritis
treated?
Once
a
healthcare
provider
diagnoses
your
bacterial
gastroenteritis,
correct
treatment
often
works.
Antibiotics
can
cure
some
forms
of
the
illness
within
a
few
days.
You
may
need
other
treatment
to
replace
the
fluids
and
electrolytes
in
your
body.
It
depends
upon
the
severity
of
your
illness.
In
some
cases,
you
may
need
IV
(intravenous)
fluid
replacement.
What
can
I
do
to
prevent
bacterial
gastroenteritis?
An
important
way
to
prevent
bacterial
gastroenteritis
is
to
practice
good
hygiene.
Wash
your
hands
thoroughly
while
handling
or
preparing
food.
Don’t
leave
food
out
too
long
when
you’re
serving
it.
Throw
it
out
if
there’s
any
chance
it
has
gone
bad.
If
you
learn
of
an
outbreak
of
tainted
food
or
drink
through
a
news
report,
don't
have
those
items.
Limit
contact
with
others
who
have
symptoms
such
as
vomiting
or
diarrhea.
Don't
eat
undercooked
food.
Use
alcohol-based
hand
sanitizers.
When
should
I
call
my
healthcare
provider?
If
you
have
any
of
the
symptoms
described
above
and
they
don’t
improve
after
1
or
2
days,
see
your
healthcare
provider
for
diagnosis
and
treatment.
Key
points
about
bacterial
gastroenteritis
Bacterial
gastroenteritis
is
a
digestive
problem
caused
by
bacteria.
Symptoms
include
nausea,
vomiting,
fever,
diarrhea,
belly
cramping,
and
pain.
In
severe
cases,
you
may
become
dehydrated
and
have
an
electrolyte
imbalance.
Bacterial
gastroenteritis
is sometimes treated
with
antibiotics.
If
severe
cases
are
not
treated,
they
can
lead
to
severe
dehydration,
neurological
problems,
kidney
failure,
and
even
death.
Good
hygiene
is
an
important
way
to
prevent
bacterial
gastroenteritis.

and

Symptoms
of
Shiga
toxin-producing
E.
coli
(STEC)
infection
vary
for
each
person,
but
often
include
severe
stomach
cramps,
diarrhea
(often
bloody),
and
vomiting.
Some
people
may
have
a
fever,
which
usually
is
not
very
high
(less
than
101˚F/38.5˚C).
Most
people
get
better
within
5
to
7
days.
Some
infections
are
very
mild,
but
others
are
severe
or
even
life-threatening.
Most
people
with
a
STEC
infection
start
feeling
sick
3
to
4
days
after
eating
or
drinking
something
that
contains
the
bacteria.
However,
illnesses
can
start
anywhere
from
1
to
10
days
after
exposure.
Contact
your
healthcare
provider
if
you
have
diarrhea
that
lasts
for
more
than
3
days
or
diarrhea
that
is
accompanied
by
a
fever
higher
than
102˚F,
bloody
diarrhea,
or
so
much
vomiting
that
you
cannot
keep
liquids
down
and
you
pass
very
little
urine.
Hemolytic
Uremic
Syndrome
(HUS)About
5
to
10%
of
people
who
are
diagnosed
with
STEC
infection
develop
a
potentially
life-threatening
complication
known
as
hemolytic
uremic
syndrome
(HUS).
HUS
develops
about
7
days
after
symptoms
first
appear,
when
diarrhea
is
improving.
Clues
that
someone
is
developing
HUS
include
decreased
frequency
of
urination,
feeling
very
tired,
and
losing
pink
color
in
cheeks
and
inside
the
lower
eyelids.
People
with
HUS
should
be
hospitalized
because
their
kidneys
may
stop
working
and
they
may
develop
other
serious
problems.
Most
people
with
HUS
recover
within
a
few
weeks,
but
some
suffer
permanent
damage
or
die.

Enterotoxigenic
Escherichia
coli
(E.
coli),
or
ETEC,
is
an
important
cause
of
bacterial
diarrheal
illness.
Infection
with
ETEC
is
the
leading
cause
of
travelers’
diarrhea
and
a
major
cause
of
diarrheal
disease
in
lower-income
countries,
especially
among
children.
ETEC
is
transmitted
by
food
or
water
contaminated
with
animal
or
human
feces.
Infection
can
be
prevented
by
avoiding
or
safely
preparing
foods
and
beverages
that
could
be
contaminated
with
the
bacteria,
as
well
as
washing
hands
with
soap
frequently.
Frequently
Asked
Questions
What
is
ETEC?
Escherichia
coli
is
a
bacterium
that
normally
lives
in
the
intestines
of
humans
and
other
animals.
Most
types
of
E.
coli
are
harmless,
but
some
can
cause
disease.
Disease-causing
E.
coli
are
grouped
according
to
the
different
ways
by
which
they
cause
illness.
Enterotoxigenic
Escherichia
coli,
or
ETEC,
is
the
name
given
to
a
group
of
E.
coli
that
produce
special
toxins
which
stimulate
the
lining
of
the
intestines
causing
them
to
secrete
excessive
fluid,
thus
producing
diarrhea.
The
toxins
and
the
diseases
that
ETEC
causes
are
not
related
to
E.
coli
O157:H7.
ETEC
was
first
recognized
as
a
cause
of
human
diarrheal
illness
in
the
1960s.
It
have
since
emerged
as
a
major
bacterial
cause
of
diarrhea
among
travelers
and
children
in
the
developing
world.
ETEC
is
increasingly
recognized
as
an
important
cause
of
foodborne
illness
in
developed
nations,
such
as
the
United
States.
ETEC
produces
two
toxins,
a
heat-stable
toxin
(known
as
ST)
and
a
heat-labile
toxin
(LT).
Although
different
strains
of
ETEC
can
secrete
either
one
or
both
of
these
toxins,
the
illness
caused
by
each
toxin
is
similar.
What
illness
does
ETEC
cause?
Infection
with
ETEC
can
cause
profuse
watery
diarrhea
and
abdominal
cramping.
Fever,
nausea
with
or
without
vomiting,
chills,
loss
of
appetite,
headache,
muscle
aches
and
bloating
can
also
occur
but
are
less
common.
Illness
develops
1-3
days
after
exposure
and
usually
lasts
3-4
days.
Some
infections
may
take
a
week
or
longer
to
resolve.
Symptoms
rarely
last
more
than
3
weeks.
Most
patients
recover
with
supportive
measures
alone
and
do
not
require
hospitalization
or
antibiotics.
How
does
someone
become
infected
with
ETEC?
Infection
occurs
when
a
person
eats
food,
or
drinks
water
or
ice
contaminated
with
ETEC
bacteria.
Human
or
animal
wastes
(e.g.,
feces)
are
the
ultimate
source
of
ETEC
contamination.
How
is
infection
with
ETEC
diagnosed?
In
the
laboratory,
infection
with
ETEC
is
diagnosed
when
the
bacteria
are
cultured
from
samples
of
stool.
The
techniques
necessary
to
identify
ETEC
are
not
widely
available,
and
physicians
may
make
the
diagnosis
based
on
a
patient’s
history
and
symptoms.
If
ETEC
is
suspected,
the
microbiology
laboratory
evaluating
a
patient’s
stool
specimen
should
be
alerted.
How
is
infection
with
ETEC
treated?
Most
infected
persons
will
recover
within
a
few
days,
without
requiring
any
specific
treatment.
Clear
liquids
are
recommended
for
persons
with
diarrhea
to
prevent
dehydration
and
loss
of
electrolytes.
For
adults,
packaged
oral
rehydration
salts
or
premixed
oral
rehydration
solutions
(both
available
over-the-counter)
may
be
used,
although
traditional
remedies
with
salty
liquids
such
as
chicken
soup
are
also
effective.
Bismuth
subsalicylate
compounds
(e.g.,
Pepto-Bismol©)
can
help
reduce
the
number
of
bowel
movements.
Although
antimotility
agents
(e.g.,
Imodium©,
Lomotil©)
can
effectively
relieve
ETEC-associated
diarrhea
and
cramps,
they
may
prolong
the
time
it
takes
the
body
to
rid
itself
of
the
toxin.
Antimotility
medications
should
be
avoided
by
persons
with
high
fevers
or
bloody
diarrhea,
and
should
be
discontinued
if
diarrhea
symptoms
persist
more
than
48
hours.
There
are
no
data
showing
that
kaolin-pectin
compounds
(e.g.,
Kaopectate©)
or
lactobacillus
slows
diarrhea
or
relieves
abdominal
cramping.
Antibiotics
can
shorten
the
duration
of
diarrheal
illness
and
discomfort,
especially
if
given
early,
but
they
are
usually
not
required.
ETEC
is
frequently
resistant
to
common
antibiotics,
including
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole
and
ampicillin.
Because
resistance
to
antibiotics
is
increasing
worldwide,
the
decision
to
use
an
antibiotic
should
be
carefully
weighed
against
the
severity
of
illness
and
the
risk
of
adverse
reactions,
such
as
rash,
antibiotic-associated
colitis,
and
vaginal
yeast
infection.
Fluoroquinolones
have
been
shown
to
be
effective
therapy.

What
are
the
long-term
consequences
of
infection?
Virtually
all
persons
recover
completely
without
any
long-term
consequences.
What
can
be
done
to
prevent
infection
with
ETEC?
For
travelers
in
developing
countries,
ETEC
infection
can
be
prevented
by
avoiding
foods
and
beverages
that
could
be
contaminated
with
bacteria.
Although
both
cooked
and
uncooked
foods
have
been
associated
with
ETEC
infections,
high-risk
foods
are
raw
fruits
and
vegetables
(e.g.,
salads),
raw
seafood
or
undercooked
meat
or
poultry,
unpasteurized
dairy
products,
food
from
street
vendors,
and
untreated
water
(including
ice)
in
areas
lacking
adequate
chlorination.
There
have
been
rare
cases
of
ETEC
infection
reported
in
the
United
States
associated
with
eating
salads,
raw
fruits,
and
vegetables.
However,
these
foods
are
generally
safe
if
handled
and
prepared
appropriately.
In
developing
countries,
food
can
be
made
safe
to
eat
by
thoroughly
cooking
it
and
by
keeping
it
hot.
Fruits
and
vegetables
should
be
peeled
by
the
person
eating
them.
Water
used
for
drinking
(including
brushing
teeth)
or
for
washing
food
in
these
countries
should
be
bottled,
boiled,
or
chemically
treated
with
iodine,
chlorine
or
another
disinfectant.
Handwashing
with
soap
and
water
also
can
prevent
contamination
of
food
and
beverages
with
ETEC
and
prevent
transmission
from
person
to
person
as
well.
Bismuth
subsalicylate
preparations
(1
oz
of
liquid
or
two
262.5-mg
tablets
taken
four
times
daily)
can
reduce
the
risk
of
becoming
infected
with
ETEC
and
other
common
bacteria
that
cause
diarrhea.
Persons
with
kidney
disease
should
consult
a
physician
before
taking
medications
with
large
amounts
of
salicylate.
Vaccines
for
ETEC
are
being
developed,
but
none
are
currently
available.
Are
antibiotics
recommended
to
prevent
ETEC?
Taking
antibiotics
to
prevent
ETEC
infection
is
generally
not
recommended.
Pregnant
women
and
persons
with
weakened
immune
systems
(such
as
patients
who
are
receiving
chemotherapy,
who
are
taking
immunosuppressive
medications,
or
who
have
HIV
infection)
should
talk
with
their
health
care
provider
if
they
are
traveling
to
areas
at
high
risk
for
ETEC
exposure.
What
is
CDC
doing
to
prevent
ETEC?
CDC
provides
advice
to
travelers
and
travel
medicine
clinics
about
ETEC
infection,
and
assists
health
care
providers
as
well
as
state
and
county
health
departments
with
ETEC
diagnosis
and
investigations
of
ETEC
outbreaks.
In
addition,
CDC,
in
collaboration
with
international
agencies,
works
to
improve
sanitary
conditions
in
foreign
accommodations
(e.g.,
tourist
resorts)
and
on
board
cruise
ships
docking
in
U.S.
ports.
Finally,
CDC
is
working
to
improve
methods
for
diagnosing
ETEC.

Infectious
gastroenteritis
is
a
leading
cause
of
morbidity
and
mortality
worldwide.
Although
viruses
are
the
major
cause
of
infectious
gastroenteritis,
15-20%
is
caused
by
bacteria.
Identification
of
the
specific
etiology
of
gastroenteritis
is
helpful
for
individual
patient
targeted
care.
It
is
also
important
for
public
health
measures
such
as
outbreak
investigations.
Until
a
decade
ago,
there
were
a
limited
number
of
bacteria
detectable
in
diarrheal
stool
by
clinical
microbiology
laboratories,
as
most
laboratories
performed
culture
to
identify
gastrointestinal
(GI)
pathogens.
Pathogens
detected
by
stool
culture
included
Salmonella,
Shigella,
Campylobacter,
and
Shiga
toxin-producing
E.
coli
O157:H7
(photo).
Some
other
bacterial
causes
of
diarrhea,
such
as
Vibrio,
could
be
detected
in
stool
with
the
use
of
additional
media,
enrichment
techniques,
or
careful
examination
by
the
technologist.
However,
diarrheagenic
strains
of
E.
coli
other
than
O157:H7
cannot
be
differentiated
phenotypically
from
normal
E.
coli
microbiota
in
stool
culture.

The
organism
does
not
ferment
sorbitol
and
so,
unlike
most
E.
coli,
does
not
form
dark
pink
colonies
on
this
agar.

Clinic,

Many
clinical
microbiology
laboratories
now
use
multiplex
molecular
GI
pathogen
panel
assays
in
place
of
routine
stool
culture.
These
assays
can
detect
anywhere
between
9
and
22
bacterial,
viral,
and
parasitic
agents.
The
advantages
of
these
multiplex
molecular
assays
include
faster
turnaround
time,
higher
sensitivity
than
culture,
and
a
broad
testing
menu. However,
there
are
some
issues
with
use
of
these
panels,
such
as
whether
all
results
are
actionable.
In
other
words,
is
there
guidance
on
the
actions
clinicians
should
take
when
certain
targets
are
reported
for
their
patients?
In
2017,
ASM
released
a
White
Paper
on
the
clinical
utility
of
multiplex
tests,
and
some
of
these
issues
were
covered.
Some
of
the
pathogens
for
which
there
is
the
least
guidance
include
the
diarrheagenic
E.
coli
pathotypes
or
strains.
There
has
been
much
discussion
recently
about
the
clinical
significance
of
some
of
these
pathotypes
in
stool.
Shiga
toxin-producing
E.
coli
strains
(STEC)
can
be
detected
through
targeting
Shiga
toxins
via
molecular
or
immunoassays.
Other
diarrheagenic
strains
(enterotoxigenic
E.
coli
(ETEC),
enteropathogenic
E.
coli
(EPEC),
enteroinvasive
E.
coli
(EIEC),
and
enteroaggregative
E.
coli
(EAEC))
require
different
detection
methods,
since
they
do
not
produce
Shiga
toxin.
The
role
of
STEC
and
ETEC
in
disease
has
been
firmly
established.
The
roles
of
the
other
E.
coli
pathotypes,
EIEC,
EPEC,
and
EAEC,
however,
are
less
clear.
Currently,
there
are
two
companies
-
BioFire
and
BD
-
which
offer
FDA-cleared
commercial
multiplex
molecular
GI
panels
targeting
several
of
the
diarrheagenic
pathotypes
of
E.
coli.
BioFire’s
FilmArray
GI
Panel
is
FDA-cleared
and
includes
EAEC,
EIEC,
EPEC,
ETEC,
and
STEC
targets,
alongside
other
targets.
The
BD
MAX
Enteric
Bacterial
Panel
includes
EIEC
and
STEC,
while
its
Extended
Enteric
Bacterial
Panel
includes
ETEC,
alongside
other
targets.
Both
of
the
BD
MAX
panels
are
FDA-cleared
for
in
vitro
diagnostic
(IVD)
use.
In
a
study
of
the
BioFire
GIP,
2
or
more
pathogens
(bacterial,
viral,
or
parasitic)
were
detected
in
116/709
(16%)
of
stool
samples.
Of
the
samples
positive
for
2
or
more
pathogens,
98/116
(84%)
were
positive
for
either
EPEC
or
EAEC.
Coinfection
rates
in
other
studies
have
been
high
as
well,
with
up
to
45.7%
of
EPEC
and
61.5%
of
EAEC
associated
with
coinfection.
Since
clinical
laboratories
have
not
historically
tested
for
several
of
these
pathotypes,
laboratories
and
clinicians
are
sometimes
at
a
loss
as
to
whether
to
assign
clinical
relevance
to
these
pathogens,
and
how
to
approach
treatment
of
the
patient.
EIEC
is
closely
related
to
Shigella
and
is
thought
to
cause
watery
diarrhea
through
invasion
of
the
epithelial
cells
of
the
colon.
It
does
not
produce
enterotoxins.
Symptoms
include
abdominal
cramps,
malaise,
tenesmus,
and
occasionally
fever.
Bloody
diarrhea
or
dysentery
is
an
uncommon
outcome.
In
fact,
Shigella
spp.
and
EIEC
cause
similar
gastrointestinal
illnesses.
Infections
due
to
EIEC
are
rare
in
the
U.S.,
although
outbreaks
have
occurred.
Rarely,
it
is
a
cause
of
traveler’s
diarrhea.
There
is
limited
information
on
the
efficacy
of
antimicrobial
therapy
for
EIEC
strains,
and
antimicrobial
therapy
is
not
routinely
suggested.
First
described
in
the
1980s,
EAEC
causes
epidemic
and
sporadic
diarrhea
among
children
and
adults
in
developing
and
developed
countries.
It
has
been
associated
with
traveler's
diarrhea,
as
well
as
persistent
diarrhea
in
infants.
EAEC
produces
enterotoxins
and
cytotoxins.
Its
name
was
derived
from
its
ability
to
adhere
to
certain
cells
in
cell
culture
in
a
pattern
resembling
stacked
bricks.
Distinct
from
several
other
diarrheagenic
pathotypes
of
E.
coli,
EAEC
strains
are
not
as
clearly
associated
with
disease.
In
a
U.S.
study
of
1267
children
in
Tennessee,
the
prevalence
of
EAEC
strains
was
no
different
in
cases
versus
controls
(17/857
[2%]
vs.
15/410
[4%],
respectively;
OR
0.52,
range
0.26-1.07).
In
a
matched
case-control
study
in
Africa
and
Asia,
there
was
no
clear
association
between
EAEC
and
diarrhea
tested
with
an
in-house
multiplex
PCR
run
on
stool.
There
is
more
supportive
clinical
evidence
for
EPEC
as
cause
of
GI
infections.
However,
some
studies
have
found
similar
rates
of
EPEC
in
healthy
controls
as
compared
to
patients
with
GI
disease.
Infections
due
to
EPEC
occur
more
commonly
in
resource-limited
settings
and
in
children
younger
than
two
years
of
age.
They
are
an
important
cause
of
infant
diarrhea
in
South
America,
sub-Saharan
Africa,
and
Asia
but
are
not
believed
to
be
important
causes
of
gastroenteritis
in
North
America
and
Europe.
EPEC
does
not
produce
Shiga
toxins
or
enterotoxins.
Thus,
the
disease
burden
due
to
EPEC
has
been
relatively
poorly
understood,
but
its
role
in
disease
has
been
established
based
on
studies
of
immune
responses,
disease
association,
and
studies
of
virulence
factors.
Antimicrobial
therapy
may
be
helpful
for
the
treatment
of
infection
due
to
EPEC
strains.
Furthermore,
different
EPEC
strains
exist;
some
are
""typical""
while
others
are
""atypical.""
The
strains
differ
in
the
rates
of
antimicrobial
susceptibility
and
virulence
factors.
Some
studies
have
noted
a
higher
prevalence
of
atypical
EPEC
in
patients
with
diarrhea,
while
others
have
demonstrated
a
higher
prevalence
of
atypical
strains
as
GI
colonizers.
Further
studies
will
be
helpful
in
delineating
these
differences.
In
summary,
there
is
some
evidence
to
support
a
pathogenic
role
for
EPEC
and
EIEC
as
causes
of
infectious
gastroenteritis.
However,
clinical
guidelines
are
unclear
as
to
the
need
for
antimicrobial
treatment
for
gastroenteritis
due
to
these
bacteria.
The
evidence
supporting
clinical
significance
of
EAEC
is
less
clear.
These
issues
are
important,
as
EPEC
and
EAEC
represent
some
of
the
most
common
targets
co-detected
with
other
possible
GI
targets
in
multiplex
stool
panels.
Additionally,
there
are
no
testing
guidelines
addressing
the
possible
need
for
repeat
or
confirmatory
testing
of
such
targets.
At
least
one
company
on
the
market
has
included
these
targets
on
their
panels,
and
studies
will
hopefully
be
able
to
further
characterize
the
clinical
importance
of
these
targets.

What
is
enterohemorrhagic
E.
coli?
Escherichia
coli
(or
simply
E.
coli)
is
one
of
the
many
groups
of
bacteria
that
normally
live
in
the
intestines
of
healthy
humans
and
most
warm-blooded
animals.
E.
coli
bacteria
help
maintain
the
balance
of
normal
intestinal
bacteria
against
harmful
bacteria.
However,
there
are
hundreds
of
types
or
strains
of
E.
coli
bacteria.
Different
strains
of
E.
coli
have
different
characteristics.
One
E.
coli
strain
that
causes
a
severe
intestinal
infection
in
humans
is
known
as
enterohemorrhagic
E.
coli
(EHEC).
It’s
the
most
common
strain
to
cause
illness
in
people.
It’s
different
from
other
E.
coli
because
it
produces
a
potent
toxin
called
Shiga
toxin.
This
toxin
damages
the
lining
of
the
intestinal
wall,
causing
bloody
diarrhea.
What
causes
an
EHEC
infection?
EHEC
is
a
strain
of
E.
coli
that
produces
a
toxin
called
Shiga
toxin.
The
toxin
causes
damage
to
the
lining
of
the
intestinal
wall.
In
1982,
EHEC
was
found
as
the
cause
of
bloody
diarrhea
that
developed
after
eating
undercooked
or
raw
hamburger
meat
contaminated
with
the
bacteria.
Since
that
time,
outbreaks
of
EHEC
have
been
linked
with
other
types
of
foods,
such
as
spinach,
lettuce,
sprouts,
unpasteurized
milk,
unpasteurized
apple
juice
or
apple
cider,
salami,
and
well
water
or
surface
water
areas
frequently
visited
by
animals.
Outbreaks
have
also
been
traced
to
animals
at
petting
zoos
and
day
care
centers.
EHEC
is
found
in
the
intestines
of
healthy
cattle,
goats,
deer,
and
sheep.
According
to
the
CDC,
the
spread
of
these
bacteria
to
humans
may
occur
in
the
following
manner:
Meat,
such
as
beef
from
cows,
may
become
contaminated
when
organisms
are
accidently
mixed
in
with
beef,
especially
when
it
is
ground.
Meat
contaminated
with
EHEC
does
not
smell
or
taste
bad
and
looks
normal.
For
this
reason,
it
is
important
to
thoroughly
cook
beef.
Infection
may
occur
after
swimming
in
or
drinking
water
that
has
been
contaminated
with
EHEC.
The
bacteria
can
also
be
spread
from
person-to-person
in
families
and
in
child
care
and
other
institutional
care
centers.
Who
is
at
risk
for
an
EHEC
infection?
Factors
that
can
increase
your
risk
for
getting
an
EHEC
infection
include:
Eating
undercooked
beef
Drinking
raw
(unpasteurized)
milk
Drinking
contaminated
water
Working
with
cattle
Eating
food
contaminated
with
animal
feces
Not
washing
your
hands
after
you
use
the
bathroom
What
are
the
symptoms
of
an
EHEC
infection?
An
EHEC
infection
can
make
you
very
ill.
Symptoms
usually
begin
2
to
5
days
after
ingesting
contaminated
foods
or
liquids,
and
may
last
for
up
to
8
days
or
more.
The
following
are
some
of
the
most
common
symptoms
associated
with
EHEC:
Abdominal
cramps
Severe
bloody
diarrhea
Non-bloody
diarrhea
Little
to
no
fever
Fatigue
Nausea
Hemolytic
uremic
syndrome
(HUS),
a
serious
complication
that
can
cause
symptoms
of
decreased
urination,
extreme
fatigue,
pale
skin,
and
anemia
How
is
EHEC
diagnosed?
EHEC
can
be
confirmed
with
a
stool
culture.
Stool
samples
are
tested
to
compare
with
the
source
or
contaminated
food
that
has
caused
an
outbreak.
How
is
EHEC
treated?
Antibiotics
and
antidiarrheal
medicines
are
not
used
with
this
type
of
infection.
They
may
increase
the
risk
of
HUS.
Recovery
for
most
people
with
this
illness
usually
occurs
within
5
to
10
days.
It
is
important
to
drink
plenty
of
fluids
to
prevent
dehydration.
If
a
person
develops
HUS,
hospitalization
in
an
intensive
care
unit
may
be
required.
Treatment
may
include
blood
transfusions
and
kidney
dialysis.
What
are
the
complications
of
an
EHEC
infection?
If
vomiting
is
moderate
to
severe,
dehydration
can
occur.
Between
5%
and
10%
of
those
with
an
EHEC
infection
develop
hemolytic
uremic
syndrome.
This
is
a
serious
complication
which
may
cause
the
kidneys
to
stop
working
due
to
the
destruction
of
red
blood
cells
and
can
be
life
threatening.
Can
an
EHEC
infection
be
prevented?
CDC
recommendations
for
prevention
of
the
infection
include:
Cook
all
ground
beef,
pork,
lamb,
or
sausage
thoroughly.
Make
sure
that
the
cooked
meat
is
gray
or
brown
throughout
(not
pink),
any
juices
run
clear,
and
the
inside
is
hot.
Use
a
digital
instant-read
meat
thermometer
to
make
sure
the
temperature
of
the
meat
has
reached
a
minimum
of
160°
F.
If
you

Key
points
about
EHEC
infections
EHEC
is
a
strain
of
E.
coli
that
produces
a
toxin
called
Shiga
toxin,
which
causes
damage
to
the
lining
of
the
intestinal
wall.
EHEC
is
spread
from
animals
to
people
by
eating
raw
or
uncooked
ground
beef,
pork,
lamb,
or
sausage,
unpasteurized
milk,
apple
juice
or
apple
cider,
or
contaminated
spinach,
lettuce,
sprouts,
or
water.
EHEC
can
cause
abdominal
cramps,
severe
bloody
diarrhea,
non-bloody
diarrhea,
fatigue,
and
nausea.
A
potentially
life-threatening
complication
of
EHEC
is
hemolytic
uremic
syndrome.
If
you
have
diarrhea
that
lasts
longer
than
3
days,
bloody
diarrhea,
fever,
or
dehydration,
seek
medical
attention.

Overview
E.
coli
is
a
rod-shaped
bacteria.
What
is
E.
coli?
Escherichia
coli
(E.
coli)
is
a
bacteria
that
normally
lives
in
the
intestines
of
both
healthy
people
and
animals.
In
most
cases,
this
bacteria
is
harmless.
It
helps
digest
the
food
you
eat.
However,
certain
strains
of
E.
coli
can
cause
symptoms
including
diarrhea,
stomach
pain
and
cramps
and
low-grade
fever.
Some
E.
coli
infections
can
be
dangerous.

Policy
What
does
E.
coli
look
like?
E.
coli
is
a
rod-shaped
bacterium
of
the
Enterobacteriaceae
family.
It
can
live
in
environments
with
or
without
air.
These
bacteria
live
in
the
intestines
of
healthy
people
and
warm-blooded
animals.
How
many
strains
of
E.
coli
cause
diarrhea?
Six
different
strains
of
E.
coli
are
known
to
cause
diarrhea.
These
strains
are:
Shiga
toxin-producing
E.
coli
(STEC):
This
is
the
bacteria
most
commonly
known
for
E.
coli
food
contamination.
This
strain
is
also
called
enterohemorrhagic
E.
coli
(EHEC)
and
verocytotoxin-producing
E.
coli
(VTEC).
Enterotoxigenic
E.
coli
(ETEC):
This
strain
is
commonly
known
as
a
cause
of
travelers’
diarrhea.
Enteroaggregative
E.
coli
(EAEC).
Enteroinvasive
E.
coli
(EIEC).
Enteropathogenic
E.
coli
(EPIC).
Diffusely
adherent
E.
coli
(DAEC).
How
does
E.
coli
make
you
sick?
The
most
familiar
strains
of
E.
coli
that
make
you
sick
do
so
by
producing
a
toxin
called
Shiga.
This
toxin
damages
the
lining
of
your
small
intestine
and
causes
your
diarrhea.
These
strains
of
E.
coli
are
also
called
Shiga
toxin-producing
E.
coli
(STEC).
The
STEC
that
is
most
well-known
in
North
America
and
most
often
referred
to
is
E.
coli
O157:H7,
or
just
E.
coli
O157
There
are
other
types
of
STEC
that
are
called
non-O157
STEC.
These
strains
cause
similar
illness
to
the
O157
strain
but
are
less
likely
to
lead
to
serious
complications.
Who
can
get
infected
with
E.
coli?
Anyone
who
comes
into
contact
with
a
disease-causing
strain
of
E.
coli
can
become
infected.
People
who
are
at
greatest
risk
are:
The
very
young
(newborns
and
children).
The
elderly.
People
who
have
weakened
immune
systems
(for
example,
those
with
cancer,
diabetes,
HIV,
and
women
who
are
pregnant).
People
who
travel
to
certain
countries.
How
common
are
E.
coli
infections?
According
to
the
Centers
for
Disease
Control,
about
265,000
STEC
infections
occur
in
the
United
States
each
year.
The
STEC
O157
strain
causes
about
36%
of
these
infections
and
non-O157
STEC
strains
cause
the
rest.
The
actual
number
of
infections
is
thought
to
be
even
higher
because
many
people
do
not
go
to
their
healthcare
provider
for
their
illness,
many
don’t
provide
a
stool
sample
for
testing
and
many
labs
do
not
test
for
non-O157
STEC
strains.
Symptoms
and
Causes
What
are
the
symptoms
of
an
E.
coli
infection?
People
who
get
infections
with
the
STEC
strain
of
E.
coli
can
have
the
following
symptoms:
Stomach
pains
and
cramps.
Diarrhea
that
may
range
from
watery
to
bloody.
Fatigue.
Loss
of
appetite
or
nausea.
Vomiting.
Low
fever
<
101
°F/
38.5
°C
(not
all
people
have
this
symptom).
How
soon
do
symptoms
of
E.
coli
infection
develop?
You
usually
develop
symptoms
of
a
STEC
infection
within
three
to
five
days
after
drinking
or
eating
foods
contaminated
with
this
E.
coli
bacteria.
However,
you
could
have
symptoms
as
early
as
one
day
after
exposure
up
to
about
10
days
later.
How
long
do
symptoms
of
E.
coli
infection
last?
When
will
I
feel
better?
Your
symptoms
can
last
from
five
to
seven
days.
Other
than
diarrhea,
are
there
serious
illnesses
caused
by
STEC
strains
of
E.
coli?
Most
cases
of
E.
coli
infections
are
mild
and
do
not
cause
a
serious
health
risk.
Cases
resolve
on
their
own
with
rest
and
drinking
plenty
of
fluids.
However,
some
strains
can
cause
severe
symptoms
and
even
life-threatening
complications,
such
as
hemolytic
uremic
syndrome,
which
can
lead
to
kidney
failure
and
death.
What
is
hemolytic
uremic
syndrome?
Some
people,
especially
children
age
five
and
under,
who
become
infected
with
a
STEC
infection
(the
O157:H7
strain)
develop
a
condition
called
hemolytic
uremic
syndrome
(HUS).
In
this
condition,
toxins
in
your
intestines
from
STEC
cause
diarrhea,
travel
into
your
bloodstream,
destroy
red
blood
cells
and
damage
your
kidneys.
This
potentially
life-threatening
illness
develops
in
about
5%
to
10%
of
people
who
are
infected
with
STEC.
Early
symptoms
of
HUS
include:
Diarrhea
(usually
bloody).
Fever.
Stomach
pain.
Vomiting.
As
disease
progresses,
symptoms
include:
Decreased
urination,
blood
in
urine.
Feeling
tired.
Pale-looking
skin.
Easy
bruising.
Fast
heart
rate.
Lightheadedness.
Sleepiness,
confusion,
seizures.
Kidney
failure.
If
you
develop
severe
diarrhea
(lasting
longer
than
three
days
or
you
can’t
stay
hydrated)
or
if
you
have
bloody
diarrhea,
go
to
the
hospital
for
emergency
care.
HUS,
if
it
develops,
occurs
an
average
of
7
days
after
your
first
symptoms
occur.
It
is
treated
with
IV
fluids,
blood
transfusions
and
dialysis
(for
a
short
period
of
time).
What
causes
an
E.
coli
infection?
Technically,
you
develop
an
E.
coli
infection
by
ingesting
(taking
in
by
mouth)
certain
strains
of
E.
coli
bacteria.
The
bacteria
travel
down
your
digestive
tract,
releases
a
destructive
toxin,
called
the
Shiga
toxin,
which
damages
the
lining
of
your
small
intestine.
The
growing
infection
causes
your
symptoms.
How
did
I
get
infected
with
E.
coli?
You
come
into
contact
and
swallow
E.
coli
by
eating
contaminated
food,
drinking
contaminated
water
or
by
touching
your
mouth
with
your
hands
that
are
contaminated
with
E.
coli
bacteria.
Contaminated
foods
Meats:
Meats
become
contaminated
with
E.
coli
during
the
slaughtering
process,
when
E.
coli
in
animal
intestines
gets
onto
cuts
of
meat
and
especially
when
meat
from
more
than
one
animal
is
ground
together.
If
you
eat
undercooked
meat
(E.
coli
is
killed
when
meat
is
thoroughly
cooked),
you
can
become
infected
with
E.
coli.
Unpasteurized
(raw)
milk:
E.
coli
on
a
cow’s
udder
and/or
the
milking
equipment
can
get
into
the
milk.
Drinking
contaminated
raw
milk
can
lead
to
an
E.
coli
infection
because
it
hasn’t
been
heated
to
kill
the
bacteria.
Unpasteurized
apple
cider
and
other
unpasteurized
juices.
Soft
cheeses
made
from
raw
milk.
Fruits
and
veggies:
Crops
growing
near
animal
farms
can
become
contaminated
when
E.
coli-containing
animal
poop
combines
with
rainwater
and
the
runoff
enters
produce
fields
and
lands
on
the
produce.
If
you
don’t
thoroughly
wash
off
the
produce,
E.
coli
enters
your
body
when
you
eat
these
foods.
Contaminated
water
E.
coli
in
poop
from
both
animals
and
humans
can
end
up
in
all
types
of
water
sources
including
ponds,
lakes,
streams,
rivers,
wells,
swimming
pools/kiddie
pools
and
even
in
local
city
water
supplies
that
have
not
been
disinfected.
If
you
swallow
contaminated
water,
you
could
get
sick.
Contaminated
hands
You
can
swallow
E.
coli
when
it
transfers
from
your
hands
directly
to
your
mouth
or
onto
the
food
you
are
eating.
E.
coli
gets
on
your
hands
from
touching
poop
(an
invisible
amount
can
be
on
your
hands).
You
can
get
poop
on
your
hands
after
changing
your
baby’s
diapers,
after
having
a
bowel
movement
and
not
washing
your
hands
completely,
petting
zoo
or
farm
animals
(many
animals
roll
in
or
otherwise
get
E.
coli
from
poop
on
their
fur)
or
from
poop
on
the
hands
of
other
people
infected
with
disease-causing
E.
coli.
Is
E.
coli
contagious?
When
you
hear
the
word
“contagious,”
you
might
immediately
think
of
a
cold
or
the
flu
–
illnesses
you
can
get
from
breathing
in
bacteria
or
viruses
lingering
in
the
air
of
a
sick
person’s
cough
or
sneeze.
E.
coli
isn’t
an
airborne
illness.
It’s
usually
spread
by
eating
contaminated
food
or
drinking
contaminated
water
that
contains
illness-producing
strains
of
E.
coli.
(Remember
not
all
strains
of
E.
coli
are
harmful.)
E.
coli
can,
however,
be
contagious
and
spread
from
person
to
person
by
the
“oral-fecal
route.”
This
means
that
harmful
strains
of
E.
coli
are
spread
when
people
don’t
wash
their
hands
thoroughly
with
soap
and
water
after
they
use
the
bathroom
or
otherwise
touch
poop
(after
changing
baby
diapers
or
older
person’s
incontinence
undergarments,
or
petting
zoo
or
farm
animals
that
may
have
soiled
fur)
and
they
touch
other
people.
People
then
get
the
invisible
E.
coli
on
their
hands
and
swallow
it
when
it
is
transferred
from
their
hands
to
the
food
they
eat
or
from
putting
their
fingers
in
their
mouth.
E.
coli
spreads
from
person
to
person
this
way
in
settings
such
as
day
care
centers
and
nursing
homes.
Diagnosis
and
Tests
How
is
an
E.
coli
infection
diagnosed?
STEC
infections
are
diagnosed
by
sending
a
sample
of
your
poop
to
a
laboratory.
Many
labs
can
test
for
both
STEC
O157
and
non-O157
STEC
bacterial
infections.
What
steps
are
involved
in
getting
a
stool
sample
to
my
healthcare
provider?
Call
your
healthcare
provider’s
office.
They
may
have
you
come
in
for
an
office
visit
and
give
you
a
sterile
stool
collection
cup
and
specific
directions
to
follow
for
how
to
collect
a
stool
sample.
They
may

specific
instructions
for
collecting
a
sample
at
home.
Some
general
instructions
for
collecting
a
stool
sample
at
home
include:
First,
wash
your
hands
with
soap
and
water.
If
it’s
possible
to
urinate
(pee)
before
setting
up
for
the
stool
collection,
do
so.
You
don’t
want
to
get
urine
in
your
stool
sample
if
you
can
help
it.
To
collect
diarrhea,
tape
a
plastic
bag
to
the
toilet
seat.
You
only
need
to
collect
a
small
amount
–
a
couple
tablespoons.
Place
the
plastic
bag
into
a
clean
(washed
and
dried)
plastic
container
and
seal
with
lid.
Wash
your
hands
with
soap
and
water.
Write
your
name
and
date
on
the
container,
place
within
another
bag,
wash
your
hands
again
and
deliver
to
your
healthcare
provider
on
the
same
day
you
collect
your
sample.
If
you
can’t
deliver
your
sample
immediately,
you
can
store
it
in
your
refrigerator
for
up
to
24
hours.
Do
not
collect
the
sample
from
the
toilet
bowl.
Do
not
mix
in
toilet
paper,
soap
or
water.
When
will
I
get
the
results
back
from
my
stool
sample?
Most
laboratories
report
back
the
results
within
two
to
four
days.
Your
healthcare
provider
will
call
you
with
the
results
as
soon
as
they
become
available
or
you
may
be
notified
of
your
results
electronically
if
you
have
an
online
medical
record
set
up
with
your
doctor
or
healthcare
facility.
Management
and
Treatment
How
is
an
E.
coli
infection
treated?
Fortunately,
most
E.
coli
infections
go
away
on
their
own.
You
can
help
yourself
manage
E.
coli
infection
by
drinking
plenty
of
fluids
to
replace
what
you’ve
lost
through
diarrhea
and/or
vomiting.
Also,
get
as
much
rest
as
possible.
Antibiotics
are
usually
not
given
for
STEC
O157
infection
because
they
can
make
your
illness
worse
and
put
you
at
risk
for
hemolytic
uremic
syndrome
(HUS).
Also,
don’t
take
any
medicines
to
stop
diarrhea
(such
as
bismuth
subsalicylate
[Pepto-Bismol®,
Kaopectate®]
or
loperamide
[Imodium®]),
because
it
could
keep
the
E.
coli
bacteria
in
your
body
and
increase
your
chance
of
HUS.
You
should
start
to
feel
better
about
five
to
seven
days
from
the
time
you
first
developed
symptoms.
When
should
I
see
a
healthcare
provider
about
an
E.
coli
infection?
See
your
healthcare
provider
about
an
E.
coli
infection
if:
You
have
diarrhea
for
more
than
three
days
and:
You
can’t
keep
any
fluids
down.
You
have
blood
in
your
poop.
You
are
feeling
very
tired.
You
have
many
bouts
of
vomiting.
You
have
a
fever
higher
than
102
°F.
You
are
not
peeing
(urinating)
a
lot.
You
are
losing
pink
color
in
cheeks
and
inside
your
lower
eyelids.
Prevention
How
can
I
prevent
or
avoid
an
E.
coli
infection?
The
most
important
thing
you
can
do
to
protect
against
E.
coli
infection
is
to
wash
your
hands
–
frequently.
Always
wash
your
hands
thoroughly
before
and
after
cooking
and
after
handling
raw
meat
or
poultry.
Wash
your
hands
after
using
the
restroom,
changing
diapers
or
after
contact
with
animals.
If
you’ve
been
infected
with
E.
coli,
scrub
your
hands
vigorously
with
soap
and
clean
under
your
fingernails
where
bacteria
can
get
caught.
Dry
your
hands
with
paper
towels
instead
of
cloth
towels
to
avoid
transferring
bacteria.
You
can
also
reduce
your
risk
of
an
E.
coli
infection
by
following
these
food
preparation
and
cooking
tips.
When
thawing
meats:
Don’t
defrost
frozen
meat
unwrapped
on
the
counter.
Keep
frozen
meat
in
a
separate
plastic
bag
(for
example,
a
plastic
grocery
bag)
when
thawing.
When
prepping
foods:
Don’t
rinse
meat
before
cooking.
It’s
not
necessary.
Washing
the
meat
could
spread
bacterial
to
nearby
surfaces,
utensils
and
other
food.
Use
a
plastic
or
ceramic
cutting
board
to
cut
raw
meat.
These
materials
can
be
cleaned
more
easily
and
thoroughly
than
wooden
cutting
boards.
Don’t
“cross-contaminate”
a
prepping
surface.
If
you
had
raw
meat
or
chicken
on
a
prepping
surface,
such
as
a
cutting
board,
wash
it
thoroughly
with
soap
and
hot
water
before
putting
another
type
of
food
(such
as
a
raw
vegetable)
on
it.
Better
yet,
use
different
cutting
boards
for
the
foods
you
are
preparing.
Rinse
all
raw
fruits
and
vegetables
under
cold
running
water
before
eating
them.
It’s
ok
to
scrub
firm
produce
but
don’t
use
detergent
or
soap.
When
cooking
and
serving
meats:
Cook
all
meat
well
(undercooked
meat
is
another
source
of
E.
coli
contamination).
Cooking
foods
well
kills
bacteria.
Use
a
food
thermometer
when
cooking
meat,
and
cook
all
meat
and
other
foods
to
the
safe
temperatures
recommended
by
the
United
States
Department
of
Agriculture
(see
references
for
link).
Don’t
put
a
cooked
hamburger
on
a
plate
that
had
raw
ground
beef
or
any
other
raw
meat
on
it.
Refrigerate
leftovers
right
away.
Outlook
/
Prognosis
What
can
I
expect
if
I
have
an
E.
coli
infection?
It’s
important
to
keep
in
mind
that
most
strains
of
E.
coli
are
harmless.
They
live
naturally
in
your
intestinal
tract
and
help
digest
your
food.
Sometimes,
however,
you
may
eat
food
or
drink
water
that
is
contaminated
with
illness-causing
E.
coli.
Sometimes
a
mild
E.
coli
infection
will
cause
a
brief
bout
of
diarrhea.
Other
strains
of
E.
coli,
the
Shiga
toxin-producing
E.
coli
(STEC),
cause
bloody
diarrhea,
vomiting,
stomach
pain
and
cramps.
If
you
are
otherwise
healthy,
you
should
recover
from
an
E.
coli
infection
within
about
a
week
without
any
treatment.
Although
hemolytic
uremic
syndrome
(HUS)
is
a
serious
complication,
it
is
rare
and
occurs
in
about
5%
to
10%
of
people.
With
early
treatment
and
proper
care,
people
can
recover
from
HUS.
Living
With
How
long
does
E.
coli
survive
outside
the
body?
E.
coli
can
survive
outside
the
body
from
hours
to
months.
It
can
live
in
soil
for
about
130
days.
E.
coli
survives
in
river
water
for
27
days
and
in
cattle
slurry
for
10
days.
On
stainless
steel,
E.
coli
was
shown
to
survive
for
more
than
60
days.
It
survives
for
at
least
12
hours
on
wooden
cutting
boards.
Many
factors
affect
how
long
E.
coli
can
live
outside
the
body
including
temperature,
presence
of
water,
availability
of
nutrients,
pH
and
solar
radiation.
How
does
E.
coli
cause
a
urinary
tract
infection?
Urinary
tract
infections
are
sometimes
caused
when
E.
coli
from
your
gastrointestinal
tract
get
into
your
urinary
tract.
This
can
happen
more
easily
in
women
because
the
anus
(where
poop
exits
your
body)
is
located
close
to
the
urethra
(the
tube
from
which
urine
exits
the
body).
E.
coli
bacteria
can
travel
up
the
urethra
to
the
bladder
and
even
up
to
the
ureters
and
kidneys.
You
may
have
been
told
–
if
you
are
a
woman
–
to
always
“wipe
from
front
to
back.”
This
is
so
you
don’t
accidently
spread
E.
coli
bacteria
from
your
anus
to
your
urethra.
The
most
common
urinary
tract
infections
caused
by
E.
coli
are
a
bladder
infection
(cystitis),
infection
of
the
urethra
(urethritis)
and
kidney
infection.
Are
there
better
food
choices
I
can
make
as
I
start
to
feel
better
after
an
E.
coli
infection?
Drink
clear
liquids,
such
as
broths,
clear
sodas
and
water.
Stick
with
bland,
low-fiber
foods
like
toast,
rice,
plain
crackers
and
applesauce.
Stay
away
from
high-fiber
foods,
fatty
foods
and
dairy
products.
When
can
I
return
to
work
or
school
if
I’ve
been
infected
with
E.
coli?
Check
with
your
healthcare
provider.
If
your
infection
was
part
of
a
local
outbreak,
your
local
state
health
department
may
have
specific
instructions
about
when
it’s
safe
to
be
around
groups
of
people.
A
note
from
Cleveland
Clinic
The
best
and
easiest
way
to
avoid
getting
an
E.
coli
infection
is
to
frequently
wash
your
hands
with
soap
and
water.
Wash
your
hands
before
and
after
handling
foods
(including
prepping,
cooking
and
serving
foods),
after
using
the
bathroom,
after
touching
animals
(especially
farm
or
zoo
animals),
after
changing
diapers
and
after
shaking
hands
or
being
touched
by
others
(you
never
know
what
their
hands
have
touched).
Washing
your
hands
can
not
only
prevent
contracting
E.
coli,
but
also
many
other
infectious
disease
that
are
spread
from
person
to
person.
Make
frequent
hand
washing
a
new
habit.
Keep
in
mind
that
most
strains
of
E.
coli
are
harmless.
Even
if
you
do
come
down
with
the
STEC
O157
strain,
your
symptoms
will
resolve
on
their
own
within
five
to
seven
days.
Drink
plenty
of
fluids
to
stay
hydrated
and
get
plenty
of
rest.
Do
call
your
healthcare
provider
if
you
have
diarrhea
(and
especially
bloody
diarrhea)
for
more
than
three
days,
have
trouble
keeping
fluids
down
and
have
continuous
bouts
of
vomiting
and
have
a
fever.
These
symptoms
could
mean
you
are
developing
serious
complications
that
could
lead
to
kidney
failure.

People
with
Campylobacter
infection
usually
have
diarrhea
(often
bloody),
fever,
and
stomach
cramps.
Nausea
and
vomiting
may
accompany
the
diarrhea.
These
symptoms
usually
start
2
to
5
days
after
the
person
ingests
Campylobacter
and
last
about
one
week.
Sometimes
Campylobacter
infections
cause
complications,
such
as
irritable
bowel
syndrome,
temporary
paralysis,
and
arthritis.
In
people
with
weakened
immune
systems,
such
as
those
with
a
blood
disorder,
with
AIDS,
or
receiving
chemotherapy,
Campylobacter
occasionally
spreads
to
the
bloodstream
and
causes
a
life-threatening
infection.

for
patients,
practitioners
should
recognize
that
yersinia
enterocolitica
has
an
acute
diarrheal
form
of
infection
as
well
as
pseudoappendicitis
which
mimics
appendicitis
(both
requiring
different
treatment
strategies).
This

reviews
the
evaluation
and

of
yersinia
enterocolitica
and
highlights
the
role
of
the

Go
to:IntroductionYersinia
enterocolitica
is
a
gram-negative
bacillus
shaped
bacterium
that
causes
a
zoonotic
disease
called
yersiniosis.
The infection is
manifested
as
acute
diarrhea,
mesenteric
adenitis,
terminal
ileitis,
and
pseudoappendicitis.
In
rare
cases,
it
can
even
cause
sepsis.[1][2][3]In
some
countries,
yersinia
infections
have
overtaken
shigella
and
salmonella
species
as
the
most
common
cause
of
bacterial
gastroenteritis.
While
most
cases
are
sporadic,
large
outbreaks
are
not
uncommon.
Humans
acquire
yersinia
after
consumption
of
contaminated
food
as
well
as
a
blood
transfusion.
The
one
key
feature
of
yersinia
is
that
the
individual
will
continue
to
shed
the
organism
in
feces
for
nearly
3
months
after
symptoms
have
subsided-
thus
detection
of
yersinia
in
stools
is
critical.Go
to:EtiologyThe
genus
Yersinia includes
11
species,
of
which 3
are
notable
for
causing
human
diseases:
Yersinia pestis,
Yersinia
enterocolitica,
and
Yersinia
pseudotuberculosis. Yersinioses
are
zoonotic
infection
with
the
human
being
the
incidental
hosts
who
do
no
contribute
to
the
life
cycle
for
the
pathogen.Yersinia
are
classified
based
on
their
biochemical
features
and
of
the
6
biotypes,
subtypes
2,3,
and
4
are
most
common
in
humans.Go
to:EpidemiologyY.
enterocolitica have
been
isolated
from
a
variety
of
animals
with
pigs
being
the
most
common
source.
The
pathogen can
spread
from
one
pig
to
another
in
a
herd.
The
bug
can
contaminate
pork
products
including
neck
trimmings,
tongue,
tonsils
and
can
spread
to
other
meat
cuts
during
slaughter.[4][5]Yersinia is classified
according
to
their
phenotype
and
serotype.
Phenotypically,
these
bugs
are
divided
into
6
bio
groups
out
of
which
5
(1B
and
2-5)
are
regarded
as
pathogens.
Based
on
serotyping,
this
pathogen
is
classified
into
more
than
57
O
serogroups.
However,
only
a
few
of
these
are
pathogenic.
The
pathogenic
serotypes
are
O:3
(biogroup
4),
O:5,27
(biogroup
2
and
3),
O:8
(biogroup
1B),
and
O:9
(biogroup
2).
The
most
common
serogroup
isolated
from
humans
in
European
countries
is
O:3
followed
by
O:9.
In
the
United
States,
serogroup
O:8
is
more
prevalent.Go
to:PathophysiologyInfection
is
transferred
predominantly
through
the
fecal-oral
route.
Pork
consumption
especially
undercooked
or
raw
pork
products
are
responsible
for
yersiniosis.
Outbreaks
have
also
been
reported
in
Norway
and
New
Zealand
from
untreated
drinking
water
contaminated
with
this
pathogen. There
are
case
reports
of
infection
being
transferred
from
an
infected
household
pet
and
through
transfused
blood
products.The
pathogen
passes
into
the
stomach,
traverses
the
gut
wall,
and
localized
in
lymphoid
tissue
and
mesenteric
lymph
nodes.
The
bacteria
has
a
70
kilodalton
virulent
plasmid
known
as
pYV
that
is present
in pathogen
species
of
Yersinia
including enterocolitica,
pestis,
and
pseudotuberculosis. The
bacteria
also
produce ureases
that
metabolized
urea
and
forms
ammonia
to
protect
itself
from
the
harsh
acidic
environment
of
the
stomach.
The
bacteria
also
produce
Ail
(attachment
invasion
focus)
and
YadA,
that
confers
resistance
to
complement-mediated
opsonization
and
prevents
phagocytosis.
The
bacteria
also
contains
Yops
(Yersinia outer
membrane
proteins)
that
arrests
phagocytosis by
block
secretion
of
mediators
including
TNF-alpha
and
IL-8.
Certain
strains
produce yersiniabactin
that
is
an
iron-binding
agent
that
can
effectively bind
iron
in
a
depleted
state.
This
further
allows
the
bacteria
to
thrive
and
grow.The
pathogenesis
of
reactive
arthritis
is
likely
due
to
an
immune
response
that is
primarily
to
Yersinia antigens
that
cross-reacts
with
host
antigens.
The
host
may
have
HLA-B27
positivity
making
them
susceptible
to
reactive
arthritis.
The
other common
post-infectious
sequela
is
erythema
nodosum.Yersinia
can
invade
the
epithelial
cells
and
penetrate
the
mucosa,
resulting
in
colonization
of
lymphoid
tissue
(Peyer
patches).
From
here,
the
organism
can
spread
to
other
organs.One
unique
feature
of
yersinia
is
that
it
cannot
chelate
iron,
which
is
an
essential
growth
factor.
Yersinia
utilizes
siderophores
produced
by
other
organisms
to
chelate
iron.
Iron
overload
is
known
to
increase
the
severity
of
Yersinia
enterocolitis.Go
to:History
and
PhysicalYersinia
infections
can
present
with
enterocolitis,
pseudoappendicitis,
reactive
arthritis,
sepsis,
pharyngitis,
myocarditis,
mesenteric
adenitis
or
dermatitis. Clinically
the
infection
can
manifest
in
2
ways:
Acute
Yersiniosis
This
condition
manifests
as
diarrhea,
abdominal
pain,
nausea,
vomiting,
and
fever.
The
duration
of
diarrhea
can
range
from
12
to
22
days.
Yersiniosis
is
difficult
to
distinguish
from
other
causes
of
acute
diarrhea
given
the
similar
presentation.
The
localization
of
pain
to
the
right
lower
quadrant
may
be
a
diagnostic
clue
for
yersiniosis. Bloody
diarrhea
is
more
frequently
observed
in
children
compared to
adults. Sepsis
has
been
described
in
infants
and patients
who
are
immunocompromised
or
in
iron
overload
state
with
an
overall
50
percent
fatality
rate.Following
the
acute
infection,
the
bacteria
may
continue
to
shed
in
the
stool
for
a
median
of
40
days
(range
17
to
116
days).
Pseudoappendicitis
Acute
yersiniosis
can
mimic
appendicitis
and
present
with
right
lower
quadrant
abdominal
pain,
fever,
vomiting,
elevated
white
blood
count,
and
diarrhea.
Patients
taken
for
surgery
demonstrate
inflammation
of
the
terminal
ileum
and
mesenteric
lymph
node
with
a
normal
appendix.
Pseudoappendicitis
is
most
common
in
young
children
resulting
in
appendectomy
in
many
cases.Reactive
arthritis
can
also
occur
after
yersinia
and
tends
to
affect
multiple
joints.
The
larger
joints
are
usually
involved
and
the
symptoms
may
last
for
30-120
days.
In
most
cases,
the
joint
symptoms
appear
7-14
days
after
the
gastrointestinal
symptoms.Another
feature
of
yersinia
is
erythema
nodosum
with
lesions
appearing
2-14
days
after
the
abdominal
pain.
The
lesions
are
more
common
in
adult
females
and
usually
resolve
on
their
own.Go
to:EvaluationThe
blood
work
is
usually
unremarkable,
but
in
severe
cases
of
diarrhea,
one
may
observe
hypernatremia
and
hypokalemia.
A
stool
culture
is
the
best
way
to
make
a
diagnosis
of
Yersinia.
Precautions
should
be
in
place
to
avoid
infection
from
stool
contact.
The
gram
stain
may
reveal
'safety'pin'
like
organisms.Blood
cultures
are
usually
negative.
Other
studies
depend
on
the
organ
system
involved.
Imaging
studies
(e.g.,
ultrasound
or
CT
scan)
are
often
required
to
determine
if
the
patient
has
appendicitis
or
pseudoappendicitis.
Diagnosis
may
also
be
obtained
from
positive
cultures
obtained
from
mesenteric
lymph
nodes,
pharyngeal
exudates,
peritoneal
fluid,
or
blood.[6][7]Serologic
tests
including
enzyme-linked
immunosorbent
assays
(ELISA)
and
immunoblotting
to
detect
IgG,
IgA
and
IgM
are
used
in
Japan
and
Europe
but
not
very commonly
used
in
the
US.
Polymerase
chain
reaction
and
immunofluorescence
assays
have
been
developed
but
not
widely
used.Colonoscopy
is
not
usually
done
but
when
performed,
it
may
reveal
aphthoid
lesions
and
ulcers
in
the
terminal
ileum.
In
most
cases,
the
right
side
of
the
bowel
is
involved.Go
to:Treatment
/
ManagementThe
treatment
of
Yersinia
is
supportive
care
with
hydration
and
nutritional
support.
The
drugs
of
choice
are
the
aminoglycosides
or
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.
Other
effective
agents
include
tetracycline
(not
in
children),
quinolones
and
cephalosporins.
Sometimes
surgery
is
required
to
drain
an
abdominal
abscess,
and
surgical
exploration
is
warranted
if
appendicitis
cannot
be
ruled
out.
It
is
important
to
note
that
in
many
cases,
pseudoappendicitis
and
appendicitis
cannot
be
differentiated
on
a
clinical
exam
or
even
with
imaging.
Thus,
some
patients
undergo
surgery
for
removal
of
an
appendix.
In
such
scenarios,
the
appendix
is
found
to
be
normal,
but
there
is
localized
mesenteric
adenitis,
which
is
confirmed
by
the
pathologist.
Antimotility
agents
should
be
avoided
in
patients
with
diarrhea,
as
they
may
worsen
the
infection.
Antibiotics
should
be
used
only
in
selected
patients
such
as
the
elderly,
immunocompromised
individuals
or
patients
with
diabetes.
Children
may
need
admission
for
dehydration
or
sepsis.
Most
patients
are
anorexic
and
may
require
an
overnight
admission
for
intravenous
(IV)
hydration.
In
some
cases,
patients
are
admitted
because
it
is
not
possible
to
rule
out
appendicitis.[8]
Prevention
The
preventive
measures include
handwashing
after
exposure
to
an
exposed
animal,
safe
food
processing,
avoiding
raw
consumption
of
pork
and
products,
routine
water
treatment
and
disinfection,
and
screening
for
the
pathogen
in
blood
and
blood
products.Go

Over
the
past
few
decades,
yersinia
infections
have
become
very
common
with
epidemics
reported
in
many
parts
of
the
globe.Since
the
majority
of
patients
with
yersinia
infection
present
to
the
emergency
department,
nurses
and
emergency
dept
physicians
should
be
aware
of
the
presentation,
diagnosis,
and
management.
While
most
patients
do improve
with
hydration,
some
may
require
antibiotics.The
public
health
nurse
should
be
involved
when
there
is
an
epidemic
because
education
of
the
public
is
vital.
The
key
to
prevention
is
to
educate
the
patients
on
the
importance
of
handwashing
and
maintenance
of
personal
hygiene.
Travelers
to
endemic
areas
should
be
told
to
wash
all
fruit
and
vegetables
and
avoid
consuming
unpasteurized
milk.
For
those
patients
who
are
hospitalized,
nurses
should
ensure
that
enteric
precautions
are
in
place.Close
communication
between
members
of
the
team
is
essential
in

About
C.
diff
C.
diff
(also
known
as
Clostridioides
difficile
or
C.
difficile)
is
a
germ
(bacterium)
that
causes
severe
diarrhea
and
colitis
(an
inflammation
of
the
colon).
It’s
estimated
to
cause almost
half
a
million
infections in
the
United
States
each
year.
About
1
in
6
patients
who
get
C.
diff
will
get
it
again
in
the
subsequent
2-8
weeks.
One
in
11
people
over
age
65 diagnosed
with
a
healthcare-associated
C.
diff infection
die
within
one
month.
Risk
Factors
for
C.
diff
C.
diff
can
affect
anyone.
Most
cases
of C.
diff occur
when
you’ve
been
taking
antibiotics
or
not
long
after
you’ve
finished
taking
antibiotics.
There
are
other
risk
factors:
Being
65
or
older
Recent
stay
at
a
hospital
or
nursing

A
weakened
immune
system,
such
as
people
with

patients
taking
immunosuppressive
drugs
Previous
infection

germs
Symptoms
of

Symptoms
might
develop
within
a
few
days
after
you
begin
taking
antibiotics.
Severe

Fever

Loss

Nausea
What
if
I
have
symptoms?
If
you
have
been
taking
antibiotics
recently
and
have
symptoms
of
C.
diff,
you
should
see
a
healthcare
professional.
Developing
diarrhea
is
fairly
common
while
on,
or
after
taking,
antibiotics,
but
in
only
a
few
cases
will
that
diarrhea
be
caused
by
C.
diff.
If
your
diarrhea
is
severe,
do
not
delay
getting
medical
care.
Your
healthcare
professional
will
review
your
symptoms
and
order
a
lab
test
of
a
stool
(poop)
sample.
If
the
test
is
positive,
you’ll
take
a
specific
antibiotic
(e.g.
vancomycin
or
fidaxomicin)
for
at
least
10
days.
If
you
were
already
taking
an
antibiotic
for
another
infection,
your
healthcare
professional might
ask
you
to
stop
taking
it
if
they
think
it’s
safe
to
do
so.
Your
healthcare
team
might
decide
to
admit
you
to
the
hospital,
in
which
case
they
will
use
certain
precautions,
such
as
wearing
gowns
and
gloves,
to
prevent
the
spread
of
C.
diff
to
themselves
and
to
other
patients.
Is
C.
diff
contagious?
Yes.
To
keep
from
spreading
C.
diff
to
others:
Wash
hands
with
soap
and
water
every
time
you
use
the
bathroom
and
always
before
you
eat.
Try
to
use
a
separate
bathroom
if
you
have
diarrhea.
Take
showers
and
wash
with
soap.
Can
I
get
C.
diff
again?
Some
people
get
C.
diff
over
and
over
again.
One
in
6
people
who’ve
had
C.
diff
will
get
it
again
in
the
subsequent
2-8
weeks.
If
you
start
having
symptoms
again,
seek
medical
care.
For
those
with
repeat
infections,
innovative
treatments,
including
fecal
microbiota
transplants,
have
shown
promising
results
(see
the
“Life
After
C.

bacteria
are
found
in
the
intestines
of
people
and
animals.
Most
varieties
are
harmless,
but
some
strains
—
such
as
E.
coli
O157:H7
—
secrete
a
toxin
that
can
cause

water
or
food
that
came
into
contact
with

can
also
spread
through
direct
person-to-person
contact.Salmonella.
Salmonella
infection
is
commonly
caused
by
eating
raw
or
undercooked
poultry,
meat,
and
eggs.
The
majority
of
salmonella
infections
can
be
classified
as
gastroenteritis.ViralNorovirus.
Noroviruses
are
the
most
common
cause
of
foodborne
illness
worldwide.
It’s
especially
likely
to
spread
among
people
in
confined
spaces.
Although
in
most
cases
the
virus
is
spread
through
contaminated
food
or
water,
person-to-person
transmission
is
also
possible.Rotavirus.
According
to
the
Mayo
Clinic,
rotavirus
is
the
leading
cause
of
viral
gastroenteritis
in
children
worldwide.
Children
are
commonly
infected
when
they
touch
objects
contaminated
with
the
virus
and
then
put
their
fingers
in
their
mouths.
There’s
a
rotavirus
vaccine
available
in
some
countries.ParasiteGiardiasis.
Giardia
is
a
parasite
that
spreads
easily
through
human
contact
and
contaminated
water.
It’s
resistant
to
chlorine
and
can
spread
in
public
swimming
pools.
Infection
can
occur
from
drinking
water
from
and
bathing
in

OverviewViral
gastroenteritis
is
an
intestinal
infection
that
includes
signs
and
symptoms
such
as
watery
diarrhea,
stomach
cramps,
nausea
or
vomiting,
and
sometimes
fever.
The
most
common
way
to
develop
viral
gastroenteritis
—
often
called
stomach
flu
—
is
through
contact
with
an
infected
person
or
by
consuming
contaminated
food
or
water.
If
you're
otherwise
healthy,
you'll
likely
recover
without
complications.
But
for
infants,
older
adults
and
people
with
compromised
immune
systems,
viral
gastroenteritis
can
be
deadly.
There's
no
effective
treatment
for
viral
gastroenteritis,
so
prevention
is
key.
Avoid
food
and
water
that
may
be
contaminated
and
wash
your
hands
thoroughly
and
often.Products

Viral
gastroenteritis
Viral
gastroenteritis
The
stomach,
small
intestine
and
large
intestine
(colon)
are
part
of
your
digestive
tract,
which
processes
the
foods
you
eat.
Viral
gastroenteritis
is
an
inflammation
of
these
organs
caused
by
a
virus.
Although
it's
commonly
called
stomach
flu,
gastroenteritis
isn't
the
same
as
influenza.
The
flu
(influenza)
affects
only
your
respiratory
system
—
your
nose,
throat
and
lungs.
Gastroenteritis,
on
the
other
hand,
attacks
your
intestines,
causing
signs
and
symptoms
such
as:
Watery,
usually
nonbloody
diarrhea
—
bloody
diarrhea
usually
means
you
have
a
different,
more
severe
infection
Nausea,
vomiting
or
both
Stomach
cramps
and
pain
Occasional
muscle
aches
or
headache
Low-grade
fever
Depending
on
the
cause,
viral
gastroenteritis
symptoms
may
appear
within
1-3
days
after
you're
infected
and
can
range
from
mild
to
severe.
Symptoms
usually
last
just
a
day
or
two,
but
occasionally
they
may
last
up
to
14
days.
Because
the
symptoms
are
similar,
it's
easy
to
confuse
viral
diarrhea
with
diarrhea
caused
by
bacteria,
such
as
Clostridioides
difficile,
salmonella
and
Escherichia
coli,
or
parasites,
such
as
giardia.
When
to
see
a
doctorIf
you're
an
adult,
call
your
health
care
provider
if:
You're
not
able
to
keep
liquids
down
for
24
hours
You've
been
vomiting
or
having
diarrhea
for
more
than
two
days
You're
vomiting
blood
You're
dehydrated
—
signs
of
dehydration
include
excessive
thirst,
dry
mouth,
deep
yellow
urine
or
little
or
no
urine,
and
severe
weakness,
dizziness
or
lightheadedness
You
notice
blood
in
your
bowel
movements
You
have
severe
stomach
pain
You
have
a
fever
above
104
F
(40
C)
For
infants
and
childrenSee
your
child's
health
care
provider
right
away
if
your
child:
Has
a
fever
of
102
F
(38.9
C)
or
higher
Seems
tired
or
very
irritable
Is
in
a
lot
of
discomfort
or
pain
Has
bloody
diarrhea
Seems
dehydrated
—
watch
for
signs
of
dehydration
in
sick
infants
and
children
by
comparing
how
much
they
drink
and
urinate
with
how
much
is
normal
for
them,
and
watching
for
signs
such
as
a
dry
mouth,
thirst
and
crying
without
tears
If
you
have
an
infant,
remember
that
while
spitting
up
may
be
an
everyday
occurrence
for
your
baby,
vomiting
is
not.
Babies
vomit
for
a
variety
of
reasons,
many
of
which
may
require
medical
attention.

CausesYou're
most
likely
to
get
viral
gastroenteritis
when
you
eat
or
drink
contaminated
food
or
water.
You
may
also
be
likely
to
get
gastroenteritis
if
you
share
utensils,
towels
or
food
with
someone
who
has
one
of
the
viruses
that
cause
the
condition.
Many
viruses
can
cause
gastroenteritis,
including:
Noroviruses.
Both
children
and
adults
are
affected
by
noroviruses,
the
most
common
cause
of
foodborne
illness
worldwide.
Norovirus
infection
can
sweep
through
families
and
communities.
It's
especially
likely
to
spread
among
people
in
confined
spaces.
In
most
cases,
you
pick
up
the
virus
from
contaminated
food
or
water.
But
it
can
also
spread
between
people
who
are
in
close
contact
or
who
share
food.
You
can
also
get
the
virus
by
touching
a
surface
that's
been
contaminated
with
norovirus
and
then
touching
your
mouth.
Rotavirus.
Worldwide,
this
is
the
most
common
cause
of
viral
gastroenteritis
in
children,
who
are
usually
infected
when
they
put
their
fingers
or
other
objects
contaminated
with
the
virus
into
their
mouths.
It
can
also
spread
through
contaminated
food.
The
infection
is
most
severe
in
infants
and
young
children.
Adults
infected
with
rotavirus
may
not
have
symptoms,
but
can
still
spread
the
illness.
This
is
of
particular
concern
in
institutional
settings
such
as
nursing
homes
because
adults
with
the
virus
unknowingly
can
pass
the
virus
to
others.
A
vaccine
against
viral
gastroenteritis
is
available
in
some
countries,
including
the
United
States,
and
appears
to
be
effective
in
preventing
the
infection.
Some
shellfish,
especially
raw
or
undercooked
oysters,
also
can
make
you
sick.
Contaminated
drinking
water
is
a
cause
of
viral
diarrhea.
But
in
many
cases
the
virus
is
passed
when
someone
with
a
virus
handles
food
you
eat
without
washing
his
or
her
hands
after
using
the
toilet.
Risk
factorsGastroenteritis
occurs
all
over
the
world
and
can
affect
people
of
all
ages.
People
who
may
be
more
susceptible
to
gastroenteritis
include:
Young
children.
Children
in
child
care
centers
or
elementary
schools
may
be
especially
vulnerable
because
it
takes
time
for
a
child's
immune
system
to
mature.
Older
adults.
Adult
immune
systems
tend
to
become
less
efficient
later
in
life.
Older
adults
in
nursing
homes
are
vulnerable
because
their
immune
systems
weaken.
They
also
live
in
close
contact
with
others
who
may
pass
along
germs.
Schoolchildren
or
dormitory
residents.
Anywhere
that
groups
of
people
come
together
in
close
quarters
can
be
an
environment
for
an
intestinal
infection
to
get
passed.
Anyone
with
a
weakened
immune
system.
If
your
resistance
to
infection
is
low
—
for
instance,
if
your
immune
system
is
compromised
by
HIV/AIDS,
chemotherapy
or
another
medical
condition
—
you
may
be
especially
at
risk.
Each
gastrointestinal
virus
has
a
season
when
it's
most
active.
If
you
live
in
the
Northern
Hemisphere,
for
instance,
you're
more
likely
to
have
rotavirus
or
norovirus
infections
in
the
winter
and
spring.
ComplicationsThe
main
complication
of
viral
gastroenteritis
is
dehydration
—
a
severe
loss
of
water
and
essential
salts
and
minerals.
If
you're
healthy
and
drink
enough
to
replace
fluids
you
lose
from
vomiting
and
diarrhea,
dehydration
shouldn't
be
a
problem.
Infants,
older
adults
and
people
with
weakened
immune
systems
may
become
severely
dehydrated
when
they
lose
more
fluids
than
they
can
replace.
Hospitalization
might
be
needed
so
that
lost
fluids
can
be
replaced
through
an
IV
in
their
arms.
Dehydration
can
rarely
lead
to
death.
PreventionThe
best
way
to
prevent
the
spread
of
intestinal
infections
is
to
follow
these
precautions:
Get
your
child
vaccinated.
A
vaccine
against
gastroenteritis
caused
by
the
rotavirus
is
available
in
some
countries,
including
the
United
States.
Given
to
children
in
the
first
year
of
life,
the
vaccine
appears
to
be
effective
in
preventing
severe
symptoms
of
this
illness.
Wash
your
hands
thoroughly.
And
make
sure
your
children
do,
too.
If
your
children
are
older,
teach
them
to
wash
their
hands,
especially
after
using
the
toilet.
Wash
your
hands
after
changing
diapers
and
before
preparing
or
eating
food,
too.
It's
best
to
use
warm
water
and
soap
and
to
rub
hands
well
for
at
least
20
seconds.
Wash
around
cuticles,
beneath
fingernails
and
in
the
creases
of
the
hands.
Then
rinse
thoroughly.
Carry
sanitizing
wipes
and
hand
sanitizer
for
times
when
soap
and
water
aren't
available.
Use
separate
personal
items
around
your
home.
Avoid
sharing
eating
utensils,
drinking
glasses
and
plates.
Use
separate
towels
in
the
bathroom.
Prepare
food
safely.
Wash
all
your
fruits
and
vegetables
before
eating
them.
Clean
kitchen
surfaces
before
preparing
food
on
them.
Avoid
preparing
food
if
you're
sick.
Keep
your
distance.
Avoid
close
contact
with
anyone
who
has
the
virus,
if
possible.
Disinfect
hard
surfaces.
If
someone
in
your
home
has
viral
gastroenteritis,
disinfect
hard
surfaces,
such
as
counters,
faucets
and
doorknobs,
with
a
mixture
of
5-25
tablespoons
(73
to
369
milliliters)
of
household
bleach
to
1
gallon
(3.8
liters)
of
water.
Avoid
touching
laundry
that
may
have
been
exposed
to
a
virus.
If
someone
in
your
home
has
viral
gastroenteritis,
wear
gloves
while
touching
laundry.
Wash
clothing
and
bedding
in
hot
water
and
dry
them
on
the
hottest
setting.
Wash
your
hands
well
after
touching
laundry.
Check
out
your
child
care
center.
Make
sure
the
center
has
separate
rooms
for
changing
diapers
and
preparing
or
serving
food.
The
room
with
the
diaper-changing
table
should
have
a
sink
as
well
as
a
sanitary
way
to
dispose
of
diapers.
Take
precautions
when
travelingWhen
you're
traveling
in
other
countries,
you
can
become
sick
from
contaminated
food
or
water.
You
may
be
able
to
reduce
your
risk
by
following
these
tips:
Drink
only
well-sealed
bottled
or
carbonated
water.
Avoid
ice
cubes
because
they
may
be
made
from
contaminated
water.
Use
bottled
water
to
brush
your
teeth.
Avoid
raw
food

What
is
Staph
food
poisoning?
Staph
food
poisoning
is
a
gastrointestinal
illness
caused
by
eating
foods
contaminated
with
toxins
produced
by
the
bacterium
Staphylococcus
aureus
(Staph)
bacteria.
About
25%
of
people
and
animals
have
Staph
on
their
skin
and
in
their
nose.
It
usually
does
not
cause
illness
in
healthy
people,
but
Staph
has
the
ability
to
make
toxins
that
can
cause
food
poisoning.
How
do
people

poisoning?

Food
Poisoning
Symptoms
Four
Steps
to
Food
Safety
People
at
Risk
Preventing
Food
Poisoning
Wash
Your
Hands
People
who
carry
Staph
can
contaminate
food
if
they
don’t
wash
their
hands
before
touching
it.
If
food
is
contaminated
with
Staph,
the
bacteria
can
multiply
in
the
food
and
produce
toxins
that
can
make
people
ill.
Staph
bacteria
are
killed
by
cooking,
but
the
toxins
are
not
destroyed
and
will
still
be
able
to
cause
illness.
Foods
that
are
not
cooked
after
handling,
such
as
sliced
meats,
puddings,
pastries,
and
sandwiches,
are
especially
risky
if
contaminated
with
Staph.
Food
contaminated
with
Staph
toxin
may
not
smell
bad
or
look
spoiled.
What
are
the symptoms
of
Staph
food
poisoning?
Staph
food
poisoning
is
characterized
by
a
sudden
start
of
nausea,
vomiting,
and
stomach
cramps.
Most
people
also
have
diarrhea.
Symptoms
usually
develop
within
30
minutes
to
8
hours
after
eating
or
drinking
an
item
containing
Staph
toxin,
and
last
no
longer
than
1
day.
Severe
illness
is
rare.
The
illness
cannot
be
passed
from
one
person
to
another.
How
do
I
know
if
I
have
Staph
food
poisoning?
You
can
suspect
Staph
food
poisoning
based
on
the
type
of
symptoms
and
their
fast
resolution.
Although
laboratory
tests
can
detect
toxin-producing
Staph
in
stool,
vomit,
and
foods,
these
tests
are
usually
not
ordered
except
during
an
outbreak.
If
you
think
you
might
have
Staph
food
poisoning
and
are
experiencing
severe
symptoms,
contact
your
health
care
provider.
How
is
Staph
food
poisoning
treated?
The
most
important
treatment
is
drinking
plenty
of
fluids.
Your
healthcare
provider
may
give
you
medicine
to
decrease
vomiting
and
nausea.
People
with
severe
illness
may
require
intravenous
fluids.
Antibiotics
are
not
useful
in
treating
this
illness
because
the
toxin
is
not
affected
by
antibiotics.
How
can
I
prevent
Staph
food
poisoning?
The
best
way
to
avoid
food
poisoning
by
Staph
is
to
prevent
food
from
being
held
at
an
unsafe
temperature
(between
40°F
and
140°F)
for
more
than
2
hours.
Bacteria
can
multiply
rapidly
if
left
at
room
temperature
or
in
the
“Danger
Zone”
between
40°F
and
140°F.
Never
leave
perishable
food
out
for
more
than
2
hours
(or
1
hour
if
it’s
hotter
than
90°F
outside).
Remember
to
always
follow
these
food
safety
tips:
Use
a
food
thermometer
and
cook
foods
to
their
safe
minimum
internal
temperatureexternal
icon.
Keep
hot
foods
hot
(140°F
or
hotter)
and
cold
foods
cold
(40°F
or
colder).
Store
cooked
food
in
wide,
shallow
containers
and
refrigerate
within
2
hours
(or
1
hour
if
it’s
hotter
than
90°
F
outside).
The
following
tips
that
are
part
of
the
four
steps
to
food
safety
–
clean,
separate,
cook,
and
chill
–
also
can
help
protect
you
and
your
loved
ones
from
food
poisoning:
Wash
your
hands
for
20
seconds
with
soap
and
water
before,
during,
and
after
preparing
food,
and
before
eating.
Do
not
prepare
food
if
you
are
ill
with
diarrhea
or
vomiting.
Wear
gloves
while
preparing
food
if
you
have
wounds
or
infections
on
your
hands
or
wrists.

If
untreated,
the
disease
may
progress
and
symptoms
may
worsen
to
cause
full
paralysis
of
some
muscles,
including
those
used
in
breathing
and
those
in
the
arms,
legs,
and
trunk
(part
of
the
body
from
the
neck
to
the
pelvis
area,
also
called
the
torso).
In
foodborne
botulism,
symptoms
generally
begin
18
to
36
hours
after
eating
a
contaminated
food.
If you
or
someone
you

Information
Clostridium
perfringens
bacteria
are
one
of
the
most
common
causes
of
foodborne
illness
(food
poisoning).
CDC
estimates
these
bacteria
cause
nearly
1
million
illnesses
in
the
United
States
every
year.
C.
perfringens
can
be
found
on
raw
meat
and
poultry,
in
the
intestines
of
animals,
and
in
the
environment.
These
bacteria
make
spores,
which
act
like
protective
coatings
that
help
the
bacteria
survive.
Under
certain
conditions,
such
as
when
food
is
kept
at
an
unsafe
temperatureexternal
icon
(between
40°F–140°F),
C.
perfringens
can
grow
and
multiply.
After
someone
swallows
the
bacteria,
it
can
produce
a
toxin
(poison)
that
causes
diarrhea.
Common
sources
of
C.
perfringens
infection
include
meat,
poultry,
gravies,
and
other
foods
cooked
in
large
batches
and
held
at
an
unsafe
temperature.
Outbreaks
tend
to
happen
in
places
that
serve
large
groups
of
people,
such
as
hospitals,
school
cafeterias,
prisons,
and
nursing
homes,
and
at
events
with
catered
food.
C.
perfringens
outbreaks
occur
most
often
in
November
and
December.
Many
of
these
outbreaks
have
been
linked
to
foods
commonly
served
during
the
holidays,
such
as
turkey
and
roast
beef.
Anyone
can
get
food
poisoning
from
C.
perfringens.
Young
children
and
older
adults
are
at
higher
risk
for
severe
illness.
Top
of
PageSymptoms
Most
people
with
C.
perfringens
infection
develop
diarrhea
and
stomach
cramps
within
6
to
24
hours
after
eating
contaminated
food.
The
illness
usually
begins
suddenly
and
lasts
for
less
than
24
hours.
Diarrhea
can
cause
dehydration,
so
it’s
important
to
drink
plenty
of
fluids.
This
infection
usually
does
not
cause
fever
or
vomiting,
and
it
cannot
be
passed
from
one
person
to
another.
Diagnosis
and
Treatment
Most
people
with
C.
perfringens
infection
do
not
receive
a
diagnosis.
Infection
is
confirmed
when
a
laboratory
test
detects
the
bacteria
or
their
toxin
in
a
stool
(poop)
sample
or
the
bacteria
are
found
in
food
linked
to
illness.
However,
clinical
laboratories
do
not
routinely
test
for
C.
perfringens
infection,
and
public
health
laboratories
usually
test
for
it
only
when
it
is
the
suspected
cause
of
an
outbreak.
More
information
for
healthcare
professionals
Most
people
recover
from
C.
perfringens
infection
without
antibiotic
treatment.
Patients
should
drink
extra
fluids
as
long
as
diarrhea
lasts.
Report
Food
Poisoning
If
you
think
you
or
someone
you
know
got
sick
from
food,
even
if
you
don’t
know
what
food
it
was,
please
report
it
to
your
local
health
department.
Reporting
an
illness
can
help
public
health
officials
identify
a
foodborne
disease
outbreak
and
keep
others
from
getting
sick.
Prevention
Cook
food
to
a
safe
temperatureexternal
icon,
especially
beef
roasts
and
whole
poultry.
After
food
is
cooked,
keep
it
at
140°F
or
warmer
or
40°F
or
colderexternal
icon if
it
will
not
be
served
and
eaten
soon.
Refrigerate
leftovers
at
40°F
or
colder
within
2
hours
after
cooking
the
food
or
within
2
hours
after
removing
it
from
an
appliance
that’s
keeping
it
at
a
safe
temperature.
Refrigerate
within
1
hour
if
the
outside
temperature
is
above
90°F.
It
is
OK
to
put
hot
foods
directly
into
the
refrigerator.
Divide
large
pots
of
food,
such
as
soups
and
stews,
and
large
cuts
of
meats,
such
as
roasts,
into
small
quantities
for
refrigeration.
This
helps
food
cool
quickly
enough
to
prevent
bacteria
from
growing.
Reheat
leftovers
to
at
least
165°F
before
serving.

poisoning.

poisoning
caused
by
B.
cereus
is
an
acute
intoxication
that
occurs
when
this
microorganism
produces
toxins,
causing
two
types
of
gastrointestinal
illness:
an
emetic
(vomiting)
syndrome
or
a
diarrhoeal
syndrome.
B.
cereus
is
considered
a
relatively
common
cause
of
gastroenteritis
worldwide.
In
Canada,
over
36,000
cases
of
foodborne
illness
due
to
B.
cereus
were
estimated
to
have
occurred
in
2006.
B.
cereus
will
grow
in
food
that
has
been
improperly
stored,
therefore
proper
food
handling,
especially
after
cooking,
will
help
prevent illnesses
caused
by
this
microorganism.DefinitionBacillus
cereus
is
a
foodborne
pathogen
that
can
produce
toxins,
causing
two
types
of
gastrointestinal
illness:
the
emetic
(vomiting)
syndrome
and
the
diarrhoeal
syndrome.
When
the
emetic
toxin
(cereulide)
is
produced
in
the
food,
vomiting
occurs
after
ingestion
of
the
contaminated
food.
The
diarrhoeal
syndrome
occurs
when
enterotoxins
are
produced
in
the
intestine,
following
ingestion
of
food
contaminated
with
B.
cereus.SymptomsSymptoms
include:Emetic
syndromevomitingnauseasometimes
diarrheaSymptoms
usually
start
0.5
to
5
hours
after
ingestion
of
contaminated
food.
Usually,
symptoms
disappear
in
6
to
24
hours.
Diarrhoeal
syndromediarrhea,
sometimes
with
blood
and/or
mucusnausea,
and
may
also
includeabdominal
painSymptoms
usually
start
8
to
16
hours
after
ingestion
of
contaminated
food.
Usually,
symptoms
disappear
in
12
to
24
hours.
In
some
cases,
the
illness
may
be
more
severe.
If
you
have
serious
symptoms,
you
should
see
your
doctor. CausesB.
cereus
is
widespread
in
the
environment
and
commonly
found
in
the
soil.
It
is
able
to
produce
spores
that
are
resistant
to
heat
and
desiccation,
therefore
it
is
not
uncommon
to
isolate
it
from
both
raw
and
cooked
foods.
These
spores
will
germinate
into
the
vegetative
form
of
B.
cereus
and
grow
if
the
food
is
held
under
favorable
conditions
of
pH
(>4.8)
and
temperature
(between
8°C
and
55°C)
for
a
sufficient
time.
Although
the
presence
of
vegetative
forms
of
B.
cereus
in
food
is
always
necessary
for
foodborne
disease
to
occur,
not
all
the
B.
cereus
strains
can
produce
the
toxins
that
cause
the
emetic
or
diarrhoeal
syndromes.
In
addition,
the
conditions
leading
to
each
of
the
syndromes
differ
slightly.
The
emetic
syndrome
will
affect
consumers
of
food
contaminated
with
the
emetic
toxin
cereulide,
therefore
the
food
needs
to
be
contaminated
with
B.
cereus
strains
that
are
able
produce
this
toxin
and
be
handled
in
a
way
that
allows
bacterial
growth
and
subsequent
toxin
formation.
It
is
estimated
that,
in
order
to
produce
sufficient
cereulide
to
induce
vomiting,
levels
of
B.
cereus
should
be
greater
than
10,000
per
gram
of
food,
but
several
publications
have
documented
illnesses,
including
hospitalizations
with
lower
numbers.
The
toxin
is
produced
in
the
food
and
is
resistant
to
heat;
therefore
it
will
not
be
eliminated
by
most
cooking
methods,
even
when
the
vegetative
cells
are
inactivated.
This
syndrome
is
frequently
associated
with
starchy
food
such
as
pasta
or
rice
dishes.The
diarrhoeal
syndrome
occurs
when
a
large
number
of
vegetative
cells
of
B.
cereus
(at
least
10,000
per
gram
of
food)
are
ingested
and
produce
enterotoxin
in
the
small
intestine.
A
wider
range
of
foods
have
been
linked
with
the
diarrhoeal
syndrome,
such
as
meat
products,
stews,
soups,
sauces,
vegetables
and
milk
products.ComplicationsBoth
the
emetic
and
diarrhoeal
syndromes
are
usually
self-limiting,
resolving
within
one
or
two
days.
In
a
small
percentage
of
cases
it
can
be
more
severe,
and
deaths
have
been
reported
in
the
literature.
The
elderly
and
patients
with
lower
stomach
acidity
may
be
more
susceptible
to
the
diarrhoeal
syndrome.Tests
and
diagnosisFood
poisoning
caused
by
B.
cereus
can
be
confirmed
by
isolation
of
this
bacterium
in
food,
stool
or
vomit
samples.
Different
media
are
available
to
culture
this
pathogen.
Commercial
kits
are
also
available
to
detect
the
diarrhoeal
enterotoxin,
but
this
is
not
the
case
for
emetic
toxin.Treatment
and
drugsMost
people
recover
without
treatment.
The
administration
of
fluids
is
recommended
if
the
diarrhoea
or
vomiting
is
severe.
Antibiotics
are
not
indicated
as
the
symptoms
are
caused
by
the
toxins
and
not
the
bacteria.PreventionAs
B.
cereus
is
ubiquitous
in
the
environment,
control
measures
should
be
focused
on
preventing
growth
of
B.
cereus
and
the
formation
of
emetic
toxin
in
the
food.Ensure
food
is
maintained
either
at
a
temperature
above
60°C
or
refrigerated
below
4°C.Cool
cooked
foods
that
will
not
be
immediately
consumed
to
below
4°C
within
6
hours.When
reheating
food,
ensure
that
the
temperature
reaches
at
least
74°C.

Amebiasis
What
Is
Amebiasis?
Amebiasis
(am-uh-BYE-eh-sis)
is
an
infection
of
the
intestines
with
a
parasite
called
Entamoeba
histolytica
(E.
histolytica).
The
parasite
is
an
amoeba
(uh-MEE-buh),
a
single-celled
organism.
People
can
get
this
parasite
by
eating
or
drinking
something
that's
contaminated
with
it.
What
Are
the
Signs
&
Symptoms
of
Amebiasis?
In
many
cases,
the
parasite
that
causes
amebiasis
lives
in
a
person's
large
intestine
without
causing
any
symptoms.
Other
times,
it
causes:
diarrhea
(which
may
be
bloody)
stomach
pains
cramping
nausea
loss
of
appetite
fever
In
rare
cases,
it
can
spread
into
other
organs
such
as
the
liver,
lungs,
and
brain.
For
some
people,
symptoms
of
amebiasis
can
begin
within
days
to
weeks
of
swallowing
contaminated
food
or
water.
For
others,
symptoms
can
take
months
to
appear.
How
Does
Amebiasis
Spread?
Amebiasis
is
contagious.
People
with
amoebas
in
their
intestines
can
pass
the
infection
to
others
through
stool
(poop)
even
if
they
have
no
symptoms.
When
infected
stool
contaminates
food
or
water
supplies,
amebiasis
can
spread
quickly
to
many
people
at
once.
This
is
especially
true
in
developing
countries,
where
drinking
water
may
be
contaminated.
Amebiasis
also
can
spread
between
people
when
hands
aren't
washed
well,
contaminated
objects
are
shared,
and
by
sexual
contact.
Amebiasis
usually
happens
in
areas
where
living
conditions
are
crowded
and
unsanitary.
The
illness
is
common
in
parts
of
Africa,
Latin
America,
and
Asia.
It
is
rare
in
the
United
States,
but
is
sometimes
seen
in
people
who
have
immigrated
from
or
traveled
to
countries
where
amebiasis
is
more
common.
How
Can
Amebiasis
Be
Prevented?
Because
amoebas
may
contaminate
food
and
water,
you
can
help
prevent
the
illness
by
being
careful
about
what
you
eat
and
drink,
especially
in
developing
countries.
In
those
areas,
a
good
rule
regarding
food
is
to
cook
it,
boil
it,
peel
it,
or
forget
it.
Ice
can
also
be
contaminated
and
should
be
avoided
in
these
countries.
Everyone
should
wash
their
hands
well
after
using
the
bathroom
and
before
preparing
or
eating
food.
How
Is
Amebiasis
Treated?
Doctors
can
treat
amebiasis
with
antibiotics
antibiotics.
Some
people
need
more
treatment,
such
as
extra
fluids.
When
Should
I
Call
the
Doctor?
Call
your
doctor
if
anyone
in
your
family
has
signs
or
symptoms
of
amebiasis,
such
as:
diarrhea
with
blood
or
mucus
diarrhea
that
lasts
longer
than
2
weeks
belly
pain
a
fever
a
swollen
belly
pain
or
tenderness
in
the
area
of
the
liver
(below
the
ribs
on
the
right
side)
This
is
especially
important
if
you
have
recently
traveled
to
a
part
of
the
world
where
amebiasis
is
common.
Also
call
the
doctor
if
your
child
has
diarrhea
and
shows
signs
of
being
dehydrated,
such
as
a
dry
or
sticky
mouth,
peeing
less
than
usual,
no
tears
when
crying,
dizziness,
or
drowsiness.

ImagesDysentery
refers
to
bloody
diarrhea,
which
can
sometimes
also
contain
mucus.
It
can
occur
due
to
infectious
germs,
parasites,
and
irritation
of
the
gut
from
chemicals.
The
most
commonTrusted
Source
type
of
infection
dysentery
is
bacillary
dysentery,
or
shigellosis.
This
type
is
due
to
infection
with
the
Shigella
bacteria.Another
main
type
of
dysentery
is
amebic
dysentery,
or
amebiasis.
This
type
is
due
to
infection
with
a
single-cell
parasite
called
Entamoeba.In
the
U.S.,
most
people
who
develop
dysentery
experience
only
mild
symptoms
that
disappear
within
a
few
days.
However,
dysentery
is
a
notifiable
disease,
meaning
a
person
must
inform
the
authorities
if
they
have
it.
Doing
so
helps
to
prevent
an
outbreak
of
dysentery.SymptomsDysentery
symptoms
differ
according
to
whether
the

of
bacillary
dysenteryAccording
to
the
Centers
for

Control
and
Prevention
(CDC)Trusted

symptoms
of
bacillary

typically
begin
around
1–2
days

In
some
cases,
it
may
take
several
months
for
a
person’s
bowel
habits
to
return
to
normal.
Antibiotics
can
shorten
the
duration
of
illness
by
a
couple
of
days
and
may
prevent
the
infection
from
spreading
to
others.

Amebiasis
is
an
infection
of
the
intestines.
It
is
caused
by
the
microscopic
parasite
Entamoeba
histolytica.Causes
Expand
Section
E
histolytica
can
live
in
the
large
intestine
(colon)
without
causing
damage
to
the
intestine.
In
some
cases,
it
invades
the
colon
wall,
causing
colitis,
acute
dysentery,
or
long-term
(chronic)
diarrhea.
The
infection
can
also
spread
through
the
bloodstream
to
the
liver.
In
rare
cases,
it
can
spread
to
the
lungs,
brain,
or
other
organs.This
condition
occurs
worldwide.
It
is
most
common
in
tropical
areas
that
have
crowded
living
conditions
and
poor
sanitation.
Africa,
Mexico,
parts
of
South
America,
and
India
have
major
health
problems
due
to
this
condition.The
parasite
may
spread:Through
food
or
water
contaminated
with
stoolsThrough
fertilizer
made
of
human
wasteFrom
person
to
person,
particularly
by
contact
with
the
mouth
or

systemIn
the
United
States,
amebiasis
is
most
common
among
those
who
live
in
institutions
or
people
who

an
area

amebiasis
is
common.Click

Most
people
with
this
infection
do
not

If
symptoms
occur,
they
are
seen
7
to
28
days
after
being
exposed
to
the
parasite.Mild
symptoms
may
include:Abdominal
crampsDiarrhea:

FeverVomitingExams
and
Tests
Expand
Section
The
health
care
provider
will
perform
a
physical
exam.
You
will
be
asked
about
your
medical
history,
especially
if
you
have
recently
traveled
overseas.
Examination
of
the
abdomen
may
show
liver
enlargement
or
tenderness
in
the
abdomen
(typically
in
the
right
upper
quadarant).Tests
that
may
be
ordered
include:Blood
test
for
amebiasisExamination
of
the
inside
of
the
lower
large
bowel
(sigmoidoscopy)Stool
testMicroscope
examination
of
stool
samples,
usually
with
multiple
samples
over
several
daysTreatment
Expand
Section
Treatment
depends
on
how
severe
the
infection
is.
Usually,
antibiotics
are
prescribed.If
you
are
vomiting,
you
may
be
given
medicines
through
a
vein
(intravenously)
until
you
can
take
them
by
mouth.
Medicines
to
stop
diarrhea
are
usually
not
prescribed
because
they
can
make
the
condition
worse.After
antibiotic
treatment,
your
stool
will
likely
be
rechecked
to
make
sure
the
infection
has
been
cleared.Outlook
(Prognosis)
Expand
Section
Outcome
is
usually
good
with
treatment.
Usually,
the
illness
lasts
about
2
weeks,
but
it
can
come
back
if
you
do
not
get
treated.Possible

Answer
Amebic
colitis
is
gradual
in
onset,
with
symptoms
presenting
over
1-2
weeks;
this
pattern
distinguishes
this
condition
from
bacterial
dysentery.
Diarrhea
is
the
most
common
symptom.
Patients
with
amebic
colitis
typically
present
with
cramping
abdominal
pain,
watery
or
bloody
diarrhea,
and
weight
loss
or
anorexia.
Fever
is
noted
in
10-30%
of
patients.
Intestinal
amebiasis
may
mimic
acute
appendicitis.
[44]
Rectal
bleeding
without
diarrhea
can
occur,
especially
in
children.
Fulminant
amebic
colitis
is
a
rare
complication
of
amebic
dysentery
(<
0.
5%
of
cases)

is
common
in
tropical
and
developing
countries
with
variable
symptoms.
Ameboma
of
the
colon
occurs
rarely
due
to
the
annular
growth
of
granulation
tissue
and
can
present
as
mass
lesion
simulating
colonic
carcinoma
in
elderly
individuals.
Due
to
diagnostic
dilemma
or
in
case
of
complications,
for
example,
acute
intestinal
obstruction,
perforation,
or
bleeding
per
rectum,
the
patient
requires
urgent
surgical
exploration
and
final
diagnosis
is
made
on
histopathological
examination.Keywords:
Adenocarcinoma,
ameboma,
colonGo
to:IntroductionAmebiasis
occurs
worldwide,
but
it
is
more
prevalent
in
tropical
and
developing
countries.
Approximately
40–50
million
of
world's
population
is
estimated
to
be
infected
by
Entamoeba
histolytica
(E.
histolytica)
annually
with
40,000
deaths.
Among
infected,
90%
are
asymptomatic
and
1%
may
develop
invasive
amebiasis
or
involves
other
organs.[1]
It
can
present
with
multiple
gastrointestinal
symptoms
that
varies
from
diarrhea
to
dysentery
and
liver
abscess.[2]
However,
a
localized
infection
of
the
colon
may
present
as
a
rare
condition
called
ameboma
which
is
difficult
to
differentiate
from
colorectal
carcinoma.
We
present
here
a
case
of
ameboma
of
the
right
colon
simulating
as
colonic
carcinoma.Go
to:Case
ReportA
70-year-old
gentleman
presented
to
our
hospital
in
the
Department
of
Medicine
with
complaints
of
the
right
lower
quadrant
abdominal
pain,
abdominal
distension,
and
constipation
for
the
past
2
days.
He
also
had
complaints
of
moderate-to-high-grade
fever,
with
chills
and
rigors.
Past
and
personal
history
was
not
significant.
Abdominal
examination
revealed
an
ill-defined
mass
in
the
right
iliac
fossa
which
was
tender
on
palpation.
No
abnormality
was
detected
on
per
rectal
examination.
Laboratory
investigations
revealed
leukocytosis
with
neutrophilia.
Ultrasonography
of
the
abdomen
showed
dilated
bowel
loops
with
no
intraperitoneal
collection
and
normal
solid
viscera.
Contrast-enhanced
computerized
tomography
scanning
of
the
abdomen
showed
irregular
mural
thickening
of
the
cecum
and
ascending
colon
till
hepatic
flexure
[Figure
1].
The
approximate
length
of
involvement
of
the
colon
was
12–13
cm
and
maximum
thickness
was
2.7–2.8
cm.
Adjacent
mesocolonic
fat
stranding
and
haziness
were
seen
with
subcentimetric
lymph
nodes.
Distal
ileal
loops
appeared
prominent
(2.7–2.8
cm
in
diameter)
with
“small
bowel
fecal
sign”
[Figure
1].
These
features
were
suggestive
of
neoplastic
etiology
of
the
cecum
and
ascending
colon.Open

was
planned
for
biopsy.
After
bowel
preparation,
the
patient
complained
of
severe
abdominal
pain
and
developed
generalized
tenderness
and
involuntary
guarding.
The
patient
had
tachycardia
and
a
toxic
look.
Erect
X-ray
chest
of
the
patient
revealed
air
under
the
right
dome
of
diaphragm.
The
patient
underwent
emergent
laparotomy.
Intraoperatively,
there
was
1.5
l
of
purulent
fluid
with
fecal
staining
along
with
an
approximately
0.5
cm
perforation
noted
in
the
anterior
wall
of
cecal
mass.
The
ascending
colon
appeared
thickened.
Right
hemicolectomy
was
performed
and
end
ileostomy
with
transverse
colon
as
distal
mucus
fistula
made.
The
recovery
of
the
patient
was
uneventful
and
the
patient
underwent
restoration
of
bowel
continuity
after
6
weeks.Grossly,
serosa
was
covered
with
exudates
and
showed
a
healed
perforation.
There
were
numerous
ulcers
in
the
ascending
colon.
Thirteen
lymph
nodes
were
isolated
and
had
diameter
ranging
from
0.5
to
1.5
cm.
Microscopic
examination
revealed
numerous
flask-shaped
ulcers
in
cecal
mucosa
reaching
up
to
the
submucosa.
At
places,
there
were
transmural
ulcerations.
Ulcers
were
covered
with
necrotic
debris
with
mixed
inflammatory
infiltrate.
In
necrotic
debris,
numerous
trophozoites
of
E.
histolytica
were
seen
which
were
periodic
acid-Schiff
(PAS)
stain
positive
[Figures
​[Figures22
and
​and3].3].
The
appendix
showed
obliterative
appendicitis
with
serositis.
Thirteen
lymph
nodes
isolated
from
mesentery
showed
reactive
hyperplasia.
No
evidence
of
malignancy
was
noted.

to:DiscussionOchsner
and
Debakey
formulated
that
the
term
“ameboma”
originally
described
as
amebic
granuloma
by
Gunn
and
Howard.[3]
Ameboma
of
the
large
bowel
is
a
rare
condition
that
occurs
in
1.5%
of
all
cases
with
invasive
amebiasis
characterized
by
mass
of
granulation
tissue
with
peripheral
fibrosis
and
a
core
of
inflammation
related
to
chronic
amebic
infection.[2]
Untreated
or
partially
treated
infections
with
E.
histolytica
may
lead
to
the
development
of
tumor-like
exophytic
and
inflammatory
masses
involving
the
whole
thickness
of
bowel
wall
and
may
extend
into
surrounding
structures.
Amebomas
are
found
in
decreasing
order
of
frequency
in
the
cecum,
the
appendix,
and
rectosigmoid
colon.
It
rarely
involves
transverse
colon,
hepatic
and
splenic
flexure.[4]An
ameboma
usually
presents
as
pain
and
lump
in
the
right
iliac
fossa
and/or
symptoms
of
bowel
obstruction.
It
can
mimic
as
appendicular
abscess
and
Crohn's
disease
in
younger
individuals
and
colon
cancer
and
diverticulitis
in
elderly.[5]
Hence,
in
elderly
individual,
ameboma
can
be
misdiagnosed
as
colonic
carcinoma.[3,6,7]
Radiologic
examination
in
our
patient
revealed
concentric
thickening
of
the
bowel
wall
and
its
ring-like
stenosis
in
association
with
a
mesenteric
reaction
and
small
bowel
feces
sign,
i.e.,
presence
of
feces
such
as
material
admixed
with
gas
bubbles
in
the
lumen
of
dilated
loops
of
small
bowel
proximal
to
the
site
of
obstruction.
All
these
features
pointed
to
mass-like
lesion
in
colon,
as
a
cause
of
obstruction
that
mimicked
colon
cancer.Ameboma
may
be
difficult
to
differentiate
from
colon
carcinoma
clinically,
especially
in
elderly.
Diagnosis
is
usually
made
on
laparotomy
if
associated
with
amebic
liver
abscess
which
is
the
most
common
extraintestinal
manifestation
of
amebiasis.[8]
The
diagnosis
cannot
be
obtained
through
endoscopic
study
in
nearly
one-third
of
patients.[7]
The
hallmark
of
amebic
colitis
is
flask-shaped
mucosal
ulcers,
which
are
present
due
to
the
spreading
of
trophozoites
in
the
submucosa.
Histopathology
of
intestinal
biopsy
specimen
is
essential
to
differentiate
between
ameboma
and
malignancy.
Ameboma,
though
classically
described
as
mass
of
granulation
tissue,
can
present
with
ulcerative
lesions
in
the
colon
which
revealed
trophozoites
of
E.
histolytica
on
biopsy
examination
as
reported
by
Lin
and
Kao.[9]
In
general,
trophozoites
are
round
or
oval
having
more
of
vacuolated
cytoplasm
with
round
nuclei.
Trophozoites
can
be
misdiagnosed
as
macrophages
on
routine
staining.
Staining
with
PAS
or
immunoperoxidase
and
antilectin
antibodies
aids
in
the
visualization
of
amoebae.[10]
Trophozoites
appear
bright
pink
on
PAS
staining.
Heidenhain's
iron
hematoxylin
stain
demonstrates
erythrophagocytosis.Perforations
are
rare
but
serious
complications
of
colorectal
cancer,
with
mortality
rates
of
30%–40%.[11]
Ameboma
usually
has
a
favorable
response
to
medical
therapy,
but
in
elderly
and
patients
receiving
corticosteroids,
it
may
have
a
severe
course
and
unfavorable
outcome
in
terms
of
poor
response
to
medical
therapy,
and
rarely,
it
may
perforate,
leading
to
surgical
resection.[12]Go
to:ConclusionIn
elderly
individual,
ameboma
can
be
misdiagnosed
as
colonic
carcinoma.
Due
to
clinical
and
diagnostic
uncertainty
or
if
any
complication
occurs,
the
patient
is
usually
referred
for
surgical
exploration
and
final
diagnosis
is
made
on
histopathological
examination.Declaration

Amebic
liver
abscess
is
a
collection
of
pus
in
the
liver
in
response
to
an
intestinal
parasite
called
Entamoeba
histolytica.Causes
Expand
Section
Amebic
liver
abscess
is
caused
by
Entamoeba
histolytica.
This
parasite
causes
amebiasis,
an
intestinal
infection
that
is
also
called
amebic
dysentery.
After
an
infection
has
occurred,
the
parasite
may
be
carried
by
the
bloodstream
from
the
intestines
to
the
liver.Amebiasis
spreads
from
eating
food
or
water
that
has
been
contaminated
with
feces.
This
is
sometimes
due
to
the
use
of
human
waste
as
fertilizer.
Amebiasis
is
also
spread
through
person-to-person
contact.
The
infection
occurs
worldwide.
It
is
most
common
in
tropical
areas
where
crowded
living
conditions
and
poor
sanitation
exist.
Africa,
Latin
America,
Southeast
Asia,
and
India
have
significant
health
problems
from
this
disease.Risk

do
have
symptoms,
including:

The
health
care
provider
will
perform

Expand
Section
Antibiotics
such
as
metronidazole
(Flagyl)
or
tinidazole
(Tindamax)
are
the
usual
treatment
for
liver
abscess.
A
drug
such
as
paromomycin
or
diloxanide
must
also
be
taken
to
get
rid
of
all
the
ameba
in
the
intestine
and
to
prevent
the
disease
from
coming
back.
This
treatment
can
usually
wait
until
after
the
abscess
has
been
treated.In
rare
cases,
the
abscess
may
need
to
be
drained
using
a
catheter
or
surgery
to
relieve
some
of
the
abdominal
pain
and
to
increase
chances
of
treatment
success.Outlook
(Prognosis)
Expand
Section
Without
treatment,
the
abscess
may
break
open
(rupture)
and
spread
into
other
organs,
leading
to
death.
People
who
are
treated
have
a
very
high
chance
of
a
complete
cure
or
only
minor
complications.Possible
Complications

The
abscess
may
rupture
into
the
abdominal
cavity,
the
lining

the
lungs,
the
lungs,
or

Answer
Pleuropulmonary
amebiasis
is
most
commonly
the
result
of
contiguous
spread
from
a
liver
abscess
rupturing
through
the
right
hemidiaphragm.
[48]
However,
a
case
of
amebic
lung
abscess
acquired
through
hematogenous
spread
has
been
reported.
The
typical
age
group
is
20-40
years.
The
male-to-female
ratio
is
10:1.
Approximately
10%
of
patients
with
amebic
liver
abscess
develop
pleuropulmonary
amebiasis,
which
presents
with
cough,
pleuritic
pain,
and
dyspnea.
A
hepatobronchial
fistula
is
an
unusual
problem
characterized
by
the
expectoration
of
sputum
resembling
anchovy
paste

Amoebic
brain
abscess
caused
by
Entamoeba
histolytica
Amoebic
brain
abscess
is
an
affliction
caused
by
the
anaerobic
parasitic
protist
Entamoeba
histolytica.[1]
It
is
extremely
rare;
the
first
case
being
reported
in
1849.[2]
Brain
abscesses
resulting
from
Entamoeba
histolytica
are
difficult
to
diagnose
and
very
few
case
reports
suggest
complete
recovery
even
after
the
administration
of
appropriate
treatment
regimen.[3]

Signs
and
Symptoms[edit]
The
onset
of
symptoms
is
very
abrupt
and
the
disease
progression
is
very
rapid.[4]
Hence
finding
the
root
cause
of
the
symptoms
is
very
important
as
failing
to
do
so,
could
result
in
imminent
death.
Signs
and
symptoms
include:[5]
Prolonged
headaches
Progressive
Drowsiness
Diminished
upper
limb
movement
Trouble
swallowing
Breathing
difficulties
Low
grade
fever
Intestinal
symptoms
The
CT
images
for
the
abscesses
caused
by
Entamoeba
histolytica
are
completely
indistinguishable
from
the
abscesses
caused
by
any
other
organisms
or
causative
agents.
However,
the
brain
abscesses
are
often
observed
in
the
frontal
lobe
or
the
basal
ganglial
regions.[6]
Diagnosis[edit]
PCR
can
be
used
to
diagnose
the
parasite
Entamoeba
histolytica
The
parasite
Entamoeba
histolytica
that
generally
attributes
to
Amoebic
Brain
Abscesses
The
diagnosis
of
Entamoeba
histolytica
in
the
brain
abscesses
is
difficult
for
several
reasons.
Firstly,
the
aerobic
and
anaerobic
cultures
generally
provide
negative
results.[7][8]
In
addition,
the
CT
results
are
often
inconclusive
and
even
the
parasitologic
stool
examinations
and
abdominal
ultrasonography
often
yield
normal
results.
However,
direct
examination
of
the
abscess
capsule
may
exhibit
necrotic
material,
foamy
histiocytes,
rare
eosinophills
and
ingested
erythrocytes.[9]
Spheric
structures
may
insinuate
the
presence
of
Entamoeba
histolytica
trophozoites
with
Masson's
trichrome
stain.
Additionally,
PCR
based
analysis
of
the
CSF
can
be
used
to
positively
identify
the
parasite
in
the
system
.[10]
Combination
of
CT
scans
and
PCR
based
identification
along
with
the
serological
methods
are
the
current
diagnostic
measures
for
detecting
Entamoeba
histolytica.
Treatment[edit]
Metronidazole
can
effectively
treat
amebiasis
and
is
used
to
treat
Amoebic
Brain
Abscesses
Metronidazole
is
the
first
choice
of
drug
for
the
treatment
of
the
abscesses
caused
by
Entamoeba
histolytica
.[11]
In
addition,
luminal
amebicides
such
as
Paramomycin
must
be
administered
after
completion
of
Metronidazole
treatment.[12]
This
ensures
complete
eradication
of
the
parasitic
protist
from
the
system.
Immunopathogenesis
of
Entamoeba
histolytica
and
associated
complications[13][14][edit]
Once
the
trophozoites
undergo
excystation
in
the
terminal
ileum
region,
they
colonize
the
large
bowel,
remaining
on
the
surface
of
the
mucus
layer
and
feeding
on
bacteria
and
food
particles.
However,
in
response
to
an
unknown
stimuli,
trophozoites
often
move
through
the
mucus
layer
and
once
they
come
in
contact
with
the
epithelial
cell
layer,
they
are
able
to
start
the
pathological
process.
E.
histolytica
has
a
lectin
that
binds
to
galactose
and
N-acetylgalactosamine
sugars
on
the
surface
of
the
epithelial
cells.
The
lectin
is
normally
used
to
bind
bacteria
for
ingestion.
The
parasite
has
several
enzymes
such
as
pore
forming
proteins,
lipases,
and
cysteine
proteases,
which
are
normally
used
to
digest
bacteria
in
food
vacuoles.
However,
these
enzymes
can
cause
lysis
of
the
epithelial
cells
by
inducing
cellular
necrosis
and
apoptosis
when
the
trophozoites
come
in
contact
with
them
and
bind
via
the
lectin.
This
allows
for
penetration
into
the
intestinal
wall
and
blood
vessels,
sometimes
leading
to
the
liver
and
other
organs
like
the
brain.
Meanwhile,
the
trophozoites
begin
to
ingest
the
dead
cells
which
triggers
a
massive
immune
response
in
the
epithelial
cell
layer.
The
damage
to
the
epithelial
cell
layer
attracts
immune
cells,
which
in
turn
can
be
lysed
by
the
trophozoite.
This
results
in
the
release
of
the
immune
cells'
own
lytic
enzymes
into
the
surrounding
tissue
thus
ultimately
leading
to
excessive
tissue
destruction.
This
destruction
manifests
itself
in
the
form
of
an
'ulcer',
typically
described
as
flask-shaped
because
of
its
appearance
in
transverse
section.
This
tissue
decimation
can
also
involve
blood
vessels
leading
to
bloody
diarrhea
or
amebic
dysentery.
Occasionally,
when
the
trophozoites
enter
the
bloodstream,
they
are
generally
transported
to
the
liver
via
the
portal
system.
In
the
liver
a
similar
pathological
sequence
ensues,
leading
to
amebic
liver
abscesses.
The
trophozoites
can
also
end
up
in
other
organs,
as
a
result
of
liver
abscess
rupture
or
fistulas.
In
extremely
rare
cases,
when
the
trophozoites
travel
to
the
brain
surpassing
the
blood-brain
barrier,
they
can
cause
amoebic
brain
abscess.
Brain
abscesses
by
Entamoeba
histolytica
can
also
lead
to
renal
cell
carcinoma.[15]
However,
administration
of
Metronidazole
and
performing
nephrectomy
can
result
in
complete
recovery
in
such
cases.

AmebiasisCutaneous
amebiasis
is
the
term
used
for
infection
of
the
skin
and
soft
tissue
by
E.
histolytica,
the
only
pathogenic
ameba
in
the
Entamoeba
group.
This
type
of
amebic
infection
occurs
mainly
in
the
tropics
and
most
frequently
manifests
with
a
dysenteric
diarrhea
and
liver
abscesses.675
E.
histolytica
has
a
fecal-oral
life
cycle
that
involves
ingestion
of
cysts
and
the
subsequent
development
of
dysenteric
intestinal
disease.
Then,
the
infection
can
spread
elsewhere,
usually
to
the
liver
or
the
lungs.
Cutaneous
involvement
by
E.
histolytica
is
a
rare
event700
and
can
occur
by
direct
and
indirect
mechanisms.
Direct
infection
of
the
anus
or
perianal,
perineal,
or
genital
skin
can
occur
by
spread
from
the
colon
and
rectum
through
contaminated
stool.
Colostomies
or
abdominal
wounds
are
sometimes
affected.
Penile
involvement
results
from
anal
intercourse.
Indirect
inoculation
can
be
produced
by
hematogenous
or
contiguous
spread
from
infectious
foci
in
the
liver
or
by
cutaneous
dissemination
from
scratching
with
contaminated
hands.676,677
Cutaneous
lesions
manifest
clinically
as
painful,
foul-smelling
ulcers
covered
by
gray
slough.
In
genital
and
perineal
areas,
large
exophytic
ulcers
can
develop.676Usually,
the
main
feature
of
the
histologic
picture
is
the
presence
of
extensive
ulceration
with
necrosis
and
a
surrounding
pseudoepitheliomatous
hyperplasia.678
E.
histolytica
trophozoites
can
be
found
in
the
exudate
singly
or
in
clusters.
They
usually
measure
12
to
20 µm
and
are
strongly
PAS
positive.
They
differ
from
macrophages
by
the
presence
of
a
single,
eccentrically
placed
nuclear
chromatin
with
prominent
karyosome.679
Another
feature,
present
in
all
cases,
is
the
presence
of
phagocytosed
red
blood
cells
in
the
cytoplasm.
This
feature
is
useful
to
differentiate
E.
histolytica
trophozoites
from
macrophages
and
from
other
species
of
amebas.676
Furthermore,
the
Acanthamoeba
trophozoites
do
not
exhibit
the
characteristic
marginally
disposed
nuclear
chromatin.
A
CD59
stain
can
help
distinguish
between
E.
histolytica
trophozoites
(which
are
positive
with
this
marker;
see
later
discussion)
and
Acanthamoeba
trophozoites.
Molecular
tests,
such
as
PCR
and
ELISA,
can
be
useful
in
difficult
cases.
The
main
differential
diagnosis,
both
clinically
and
at
low
power,
is
verrucous
squamous
cell
carcinoma,
especially
with
lesions
from
the
genital
areas.680
The
microscopic
picture
can
also
be
suggestive
of
a
deep
fungal
infection,
but
this
is
promptly
ruled
out
with
visualization
of
the
trophozoites.The
massive
necrosis
and
invasiveness
produced
by
this
organism
relates
to
its
ability
to
secrete
several
lytic
enzymes
as
well
as
the
capability
of
phagocytizing
and
lysing
immune
cells.676
Although
the
host
develops
humoral
and
cellular
immune
responses
to
the
parasite,
these
organisms
are
capable
of
evading
the
immune
system
through
several
mechanisms.
These
include
expression
of
N-acetyl-d-galactosamine
(Gal/GalNCc),
a
specific
lectin
that
has
a
similar
sequence
and,
thus,
an
antigenic
cross-reactivity
with
CD59.
In
humans,
CD59
prevents
assembly
of
the
complement
C5b-C9
membrane
attack
complex.681
Also,
the
parasite
produces
serine
proteases
capable
of
cleaving
IgA
and
IgG
molecules.671View

L.
Haverstock,

Joseph
L.
Jorizzo,
in
Dermatological
Signs
of
Internal
Disease
(Fourth
Edition),
2009AmebiasisAmebae
are
spherical
organisms
that
exist
in
two
forms,
a
motile
form
called
a
trophozoite,
and
a
nonmotile
encysted
form
that
is
found
when
conditions
are
not
favorable
for
the
single-cell
protozoan.
Entamoeba
histolytica
is
the
most
common
member
of
the
Amoeba
group
to
be
pathogenic
in
humans.Clinical
ManifestationsAmebiasis
is
primarily
an
intestinal
disease,
but
may
also
present
as
cutaneous
amebiasis.
Usually,
intestinal
amebiasis
is
present
concomitantly
with
cutaneous
amebiasis,
the
skin
being
involved
by
direct
extension
from
an
internal
viscus.
Consequently,
cutaneous
amebiasis
is
most
frequently
seen
in
the
groin
and
perineal
regions,
but
can
also
be
found
on
the
face,
abdomen,
and
buttocks,
and
around
colostomy
sites.
The
typical
cutaneous
lesion
is
a
rapidly
enlarging
ulcer
with
a
necrotic
slough
covered
by
exudate.
Disseminated
amebiasis
with
subcutaneous
abscesses
has
been
observed
in
AIDS.EvaluationConfirmation
of
the
diagnosis
depends
on
the
demonstration
of
the
trophozoite
in
fresh
samples
from
the
ulcer
bed.TreatmentTreatment
includes
an
assortment
of
medications,
depending
on
the
site
of
involvement,
because
some
medications
may
be
active
for
luminal
disease,
whereas
others
are
necessary
for
tissue
involvement.
The
treatment
of
cutaneous
amebiasis
includes
topical
ulcer
care
and
systemic
medications.View

Infectious
Diseases
(Tenth
Edition),
2020Intestinal
AmebiasisIntestinal
amebiasis
includes
asymptomatic
colonization,
but
infection
can
progress
to
symptomatic
intestinal
disease
and
its
subsequent
complications
of
amebic
colitis,
fulminant
colitis
(toxic
megacolon),
intestinal
perforation
(Fig.
94.3),
peritonitis,
intra-abdominal
abscess,
amebic
appendicitis,
hemorrhage,
ameboma
(a
tumor-like
mass
of
granulation
tissue
arising
from
amebiasis),
amebic
stricture,
and
perianal
cutaneous
amebiasis.Asymptomatic
intestinal
infection
with
E.
histolytica/E.
dispar/E.
moshkovskii
may
be
diagnosed
incidentally
during
stool
examination
for
ova
and
parasites,
for
instance,
during
screening
post-travelers
or
in
immigrants.
Symptomatic
disease
is
mostly
associated
with
E.
histolytica
infection.Intestinal
amebiasis
presents
as
a
spectrum
of
disease
from
acute
amebic
dysenteric
colitis
to
a
more
chronic
non-dysenteric
colitis
that
presents
sub-acutely
with
a
non-specific
watery
diarrhea,
and
can
be
misdiagnosed
as
inflammatory
bowel
disease
(IBD).25
Approximately
8%
of
E.
histolytica–associated
diarrhea
cases
will
have
visible
blood
(dysentery),26
and
abdominal
pain
is
seen
in
≈40%.
Fever
occurs
in
a
minority
of
cases.
Onset
of
symptoms
is
often
gradual
over
several
weeks
and
is
often
associated
with
weight
loss.Patients
with
extensive
trans-mural
colonic
involvement
may
present
acutely
with
concomitant
bacterial
peritonitis
after
intestinal
perforation.
These
patients
are
toxic,
febrile,
and
hypotensive
and
have
profuse
bloody
diarrhea,
diffuse
abdominal
pain,
and
abdominal
distension
with
signs
of
peritoneal
irritation.
Fulminant
colitis
or
toxic
megacolon
occurs
rarely
(<0.5%
of
cases),
but
is
associated
with
a
mortality
of
more
than
40%.
Malnourished
persons,
pregnant
women,
corticosteroid
users,
and
very
young
children
may
be
at
increased
risk
of
developing
more
severe
complications.25
Surgical
intervention
is
indicated
for
bowel
perforation,
although
attempts
to
suture
such
necrotic
bowels
are
usually
unsuccessful.Some
report
a
chronic
syndrome
of
intermittent
diarrhea,
abdominal
pain,
flatulence,
and
weight
loss
for
months
in
patients
with
ameba
in
the
stool
and
positive
anti-amebic
serologic
tests.
Not
all
patients
respond
to
anti-amebic
therapy,
so
the
role
of
E.
histolytica
in
all
instances
is
unclear.
However,
a
trial
of
therapy
is
reasonable,
as
is
ruling
out
IBD,
as
amebiasis
may
worsen
if
corticosteroids
are
started.The
formation
of
annular
colonic
granulation
tissue
at
a
single
or
multiple
sites
after
the
healing
of
amebic
ulcers
leads
to
an
intestinal
mass
called
an
ameboma.
It
usually
involves
the
cecum
or
ascending
colon
and
may
mimic
carcinoma
of
the
colon.
The
same
fibrosis
may
also
lead
to
intestinal
stricture.
Amebic
appendicitis
almost
always
occurs
as
a
complication
of
trans-mural
amebic
colitis
and
should
be
considered
in
the
presence
of
other
signs
of
amebiasis.
However,
isolated
amebic
appendicitis
has
been
described
in
a
patient
with
a
prior
history
of
colitis.27Peri-anal
amebiasis
may
result
from
extension
of
severe
bowel
disease
to
the
skin.
Lesions
can
be
ulcerative
or
condylomatous,
enlarge
slowly
over
weeks
to
months,
and
result
in
pain
and
bleeding.
The
diagnosis
of
cutaneous
amebiasis
requires
a
high
index
of
suspicion,
especially
primary
disease
not
associated
with
intestinal
symptoms.
The
characteristic
cutaneous
ulcer
is
well
demarcated,
round,
or
oval,
with
heaped-up
borders
and
an
erythematous
halo.
Motile
trophozoites
can
be
visualized
in
a
fresh
smear
of
the
ulcer
exudate
or
a
scraping
of
the
ulcer
edge.View

William
A.
PetriJr,
in
Tropical
Infectious
Diseases
(Third
Edition),
2011The
DiseaseAsymptomatic
ColonizationNoninvasive
intestinal
infection
is
presumed
to
be
the
only
presentation
of
E.
dispar
and
E.
moshkovskii
infection
and
is
also
a
common
presentation
of
E.
histolytica
infection
(Box
92.3).
Colonization
with
E.
dispar
and
E.
moshkovskii
does
not
require
intervention
on
the
part
of
the
physician,
as
these
amebae
have
not
been
shown
to
be
a
cause
of
colitis
or
abscess.
In
contrast,
patients
colonized
with
E.
histolytica
are
at
risk
of
future
(months
to
even
years
later)
development
of
invasive
disease
and
should
be
treated
if
coincidentally
diagnosed.65
Antigen
detection
tests
to
distinguish
E.
histolytica
from
E.
dispar
and
E.
moshkovskii
infection
are
commercially
available
for
clinical
use
(see
Diagnosis,
below).Amebic
DiarrheaDiarrhea
is
the
most
common
disease
manifestation
of
E.
histolytica
infection.
Amebic
diarrhea
is
defined
as
diarrhea
in
an
E.
histolytica-infected
individual.
The
presence
of
mucus
or
visible
or
microscopic
blood
in
the
stool
is
not
required
for
the
diagnosis
of
amebic
diarrhea.
In
a
community-based
study
of
a
cohort
of
preschool
children
in
Bangladesh,
the
annual
incidence
of
amebic
infection,
diarrhea,
and
dysentery
was
45%,
9%,
and
3%
respectively.66Dysentery
and
ColitisThe
major
concern
of
the
physician
confronted
with
a
patient
with
dysentery
(diarrhea
that
contains
visible
or
microscopic
blood)
is
to
differentiate
between
infectious
causes
(including
amebiasis,
Shigella,
Salmonella,
Campylobacter,
and
enteroinvasive
and
enterohemorrhagic
Escherichia
coli)
and
noninfectious
causes
(including
inflammatory
bowel
disease,
ischemic
colitis,
and
gastrointestinal
bleeding
secondary
to
arteriovenous
malformations
or
diverticulitis).67
It
is
at
times
difficult
to
make
the
diagnosis
of
amebic
colitis,
as
the
presentation
of
the
illness
may
be
insidious
or
chronic,
bleeding
may
occur
without
diarrhea,
and
fever
is
an
unusual
finding.
A
single
stool
examination
for
parasites
is
insensitive,
histopathologic
confirmation
of
infection
on
biopsy
specimens
may
be
difficult,
and
serologic
tests
for
anti-amebic
antibodies
are
not
always
positive
in
the
acute
setting
(Table
92.1).In
a
developed
country
such
as
the
United
States,
most
patients
with
amebiasis
will
be
immigrants
or
travelers
from
areas
with
endemic
amebiasis.
Patients
with
amebic
colitis
typically
present
with
a
history
over
several
weeks
of
gradual
onset
of
abdominal
pain
and
tenderness,
diarrhea,
and
bloody
stools.
In
one
series,
patients
with
amebic
colitis
had
an
average
duration
of
prehospital
illness
of
21
days,
compared
with
4
days
for
patients
with
shigellosis.68
Because
of
the
gradual
onset,
weight
loss
is
a
common
finding.
Surprisingly,
fever
is
present
in
only
the
minority
(8–38%)
of
patients
with
amebic
colitis.68,69
Examination
of
stools
reveals
that
they
are
uniformly
positive
for
occult
blood.69
Colonic
lesions
can
vary
from
only
mucosal
thickening,
to
flask-shaped
ulcerations,
to
necrosis
of
the
intestinal
wall
(Fig.
92.5).Unusual
manifestations
of
amebic
colitis
include
acute
necrotizing
colitis,
ameboma
(granulation
tissue
in
colonic
lumen
mimicking
colonic
cancer
in
appearance),
cutaneous
amebiasis,
and
rectovaginal
fistulas.
Acute
fulminant
or
necrotizing
colitis
is
the
most
feared
complication,
occurs
in
about
0.5%
of
cases,
may
require
surgical
intervention,
and
has
a
mortality
greater
than
40%.70,71
Abdominal
pain,
distension,
and
rebound
tenderness
are
present
in
most
patients
with
fulminant
colitis,
although
frank
guarding
is
uncommon.Liver
AbscessA
typical
patient
with
an
amebic
liver
abscess
is
an
adult
male,
age
20–40,
from
a
country
with
endemic
amebiasis.
A
1–2-week
history
of
fever
and
abdominal
pain
is
common.
Signs
of
amebic
liver
abscess
include
right
upper-quadrant
pain,
fever
of
38.5–39.5°C,
leukocytosis,
abnormal
serum
transaminases
and
alkaline
phosphatase,
an
elevated
right
hemidiaphragm,
and
a
defect
on
hepatic
imaging
study58,59,72,73
(Table
92.2
and
Fig.
92.6).
A
more
chronic
presentation
of
2–12
weeks
of
weight
loss,
fever,
and
abdominal
pain
has
been
reported
in
a
subset
of
patients
with
single
abscesses.59
Roughly
90%
of
patients
with
liver
abscess
are
males,
although
in
children
(especially
infants)74,75
the
sex
distribution
is
equal.
The
abscess
is
single
and
in
the
right
lobe
of
the
liver
80%
of
the
time.
However,
the
most
common
location
for
a
pyogenic
abscess
is
also
in
the
right
lobe,
so
the
location
is
not
helpful
in
distinguishing
the
cause
of
an
abscess.76,77
Patients
with
pyogenic,
as
opposed
to
amebic,
liver
abscesses
are
more
likely
to
be
older
than
50
years,
present
with
jaundice,
pruritus,
sepsis,
or
shock,
and
have
a
palpable
mass.78Most
patients
with
liver
abscess
do
not
have
concurrent
colitis,
although
a
history
of
dysentery
within
the
last
year
can
sometimes
be
obtained.
Amebae
are
infrequently
identified
microscopically
in
the
stool
(18%
of
cases)
at
the
time
of
diagnosis
of
liver
abscess,
although
they
can
be
identified
in
the
stool
by
culture
in
the
majority
of
patients.
Liver
abscess
can
present
acutely
with
fever,
right
upper
abdominal
tenderness
and
pain,
or
subacutely
with
prominent
weight
loss,
fever,
and
abdominal
pain.
The
peripheral
white
blood
cell
count
and
alkaline
phosphatase
level
are
often
elevated.
Chest
radiograph
demonstrates
elevation
of
the
right
hemidiaphragm
in
most
patients.79,80
Early
evaluation
of
the
hepatobiliary
system
with
ultrasound,
computed
tomography
(CT),
or
magnetic
resonance
imaging
(MRI)
is
essential
to
demonstrate
the
abscess
in
the
liver.
Direct
extension
of
the
liver
abscess
to
the
pleura
or
pericardium
may
rarely
occur.The
differential
diagnosis
of
the
lesion
in
the
liver
would
include
pyogenic
abscess
(less
likely
if
the
gallbladder
and
intrahepatic
ducts
appear
normal),
hepatoma,
and
echinococcal
cyst
(unlikely
to
present
acutely
with
fever
and
abdominal
pain).
Aspiration
of
the
abscess
is
occasionally
required
to
diagnose
amebiasis.
The
lack
of
bacterial
infection
in
the
abscess
fluid
is
most
helpful
in
ruling
out
a
pyogenic
abscess;
amebae
are
rarely
visualized
in
the
pus
in
only
the
minority
of
cases
but
PCR
for
E.
histolytica
appears
to
be
very
sensitive.
Antibodies
to
E.
histolytica
are
present
in
the
serum
of
92–97%
of
patients
on
acute
presentation
with
amebic
liver
abscess,
and
therefore
are
very
useful
diagnostically.
Because
a
significant
proportion
of
the
population
in
developing
countries
is
seropositive,
antibody
tests
are
less
specific
in
residents
or
immigrants
from
the
developing
world
(see
Diagnosis,
below).Metastatic
AmebiasisThe
lung
is
the
second
most
common
extraintestinal
site
of
E.
histolytica
disease
after
the
liver,
and
most
commonly
occurs
from
extension
of
a
hepatic
abscess.
Pulmonary
consolidation,
abscesses,
or
bronchohepatic
fistulas
may
be
seen,
and
an
empyema
may
develop
from
rupture
of
a
liver
abscess
into
the
pleural
space.
The
right
lower
lobe
of
the
lung
is
most
commonly
involved,
although
any
lobe
can
be
affected.81
Pulmonary
amebiasis
as
a
result
of
haematogenous
spread
without
liver
abscess
has
been
described
in
a
patient
presenting
with
superior
vena
cava
syndrome.82
Pericardial
amebiasis
is
a
rare
form
of
thoracic
amebiasis.
This
usually
occurs
by
direct
extension
from
an
amebic
abscess
in
the
left
lobe
of
the
liver,
but
can
occur
from
infection
of
the
right
lobe
of
the
liver,
lungs,
or
pleura.
Symptoms
may
include
chest
pain
and
dyspnea.
Pericarditis,
pericardial
effusion,
and
cardiac
tamponade
can
result
from
amebic
involvement
of
the
pericardium.81An
amebic
brain
abscess
due
to
E.
histolytica
can
present
without
evidence
for
E.
histolytica
disease
elsewhere,82
although
it
most
commonly
presents
in
individuals
with
an
amebic
liver
abscess.83Recently
the
first
case
of
E.
histolytica
encephalitis
was
diagnosed
by
PCR
of
cerebrospinal
fluid.
The
patient
was
successfully
treated
with
metronidazole.84
Cutaneous
amebiasis
presents
with
painful
ulcers,
laden
with
amebae.
It
most
commonly
occurs
in
association
with
amebic
colitis,
and
involvement
of
the
perianal
area
and
genitalia
is
most
frequent.85
Rare
cases
of
amebic
involvement
of
other
organs,
including
the
kidneys86,87
and
spleen,88
have
been
reported.View

Amebiasis
What
Is
Amebiasis?
Amebiasis
(am-uh-BYE-eh-sis)
is
an
infection
of
the
intestines
with
a
parasite
called
Entamoeba
histolytica
(E.
histolytica).
The
parasite
is
an
amoeba
(uh-MEE-buh),
a
single-celled
organism.
People
can
get
this
parasite
by
eating
or
drinking
something
that's
contaminated
with
it.
What
Are
the
Signs
&
Symptoms
of
Amebiasis?
In
many
cases,
the
parasite
that
causes
amebiasis
lives
in
a
person's
large
intestine
without
causing
any
symptoms.
Other
times,
it
causes:
diarrhea
(which
may
be
bloody)
stomach
pains
cramping
nausea
loss
of
appetite
fever
In
rare
cases,
it
can
spread
into
other
organs
such
as
the
liver,
lungs,
and
brain.
For
some
people,
symptoms
of
amebiasis
can
begin
within
days
to
weeks
of
swallowing
contaminated
food
or
water.
For
others,
symptoms
can
take
months
to
appear.
How
Does
Amebiasis
Spread?
Amebiasis
is
contagious.
People
with
amoebas
in
their
intestines
can
pass
the
infection
to
others
through
stool
(poop)
even
if
they
have
no
symptoms.
When
infected
stool
contaminates
food
or
water
supplies,
amebiasis
can
spread
quickly
to
many
people
at
once.
This
is
especially
true
in
developing
countries,
where
drinking
water
may
be
contaminated.
Amebiasis
also
can
spread
between
people
when
hands
aren't
washed
well,
contaminated
objects
are
shared,
and
by
sexual
contact.
Amebiasis
usually
happens
in
areas
where
living
conditions
are
crowded
and
unsanitary.
The
illness
is
common
in
parts
of
Africa,
Latin
America,
and
Asia.
It
is
rare
in
the
United
States,
but
is
sometimes
seen
in
people
who
have
immigrated
from
or
traveled
to
countries
where
amebiasis
is
more
common.
How
Can
Amebiasis
Be
Prevented?
Because
amoebas
may
contaminate
food
and
water,
you
can
help
prevent
the
illness
by
being
careful
about
what
you
eat
and
drink,
especially
in
developing
countries.
In
those
areas,
a
good
rule
regarding
food
is
to
cook
it,
boil
it,
peel
it,
or
forget
it.
Ice
can
also
be
contaminated
and
should
be
avoided
in
these
countries.
Everyone
should
wash
their
hands
well
after
using
the
bathroom
and
before
preparing
or
eating
food.
How
Is
Amebiasis
Treated?
Doctors
can
treat
amebiasis
with
antibiotics
antibiotics.
Some
people
need
more
treatment,
such
as
extra
fluids.
When
Should
I
Call
the
Doctor?
Call
your
doctor
if
anyone
in
your
family
has
signs
or
symptoms
of
amebiasis,
such
as:
diarrhea
with
blood
or
mucus
diarrhea
that
lasts
longer
than
2
weeks
belly
pain
a
fever
a
swollen
belly
pain
or
tenderness
in
the
area
of
the
liver
(below
the
ribs
on
the
right
side)
This
is
especially
important
if
you
have
recently
traveled
to
a
part
of
the
world
where
amebiasis
is
common.
Also
call
the
doctor
if
your
child
has
diarrhea
and
shows
signs
of
being
dehydrated,
such
as
a
dry
or
sticky
mouth,
peeing
less
than
usual,
no
tears
when
crying,
dizziness,
or
drowsiness.

What
is
amebiasis?
Amebiasis
is
a
disease
caused
by
a
one-celled
parasite
called Entamoeba
histolytica.
Who
is
at
risk
for
amebiasis?
Although
anyone
can
have
this
disease,
it
is
more
common
in
people
who
live
in
tropical
areas
with
poor
sanitary
conditions.
In
the
United
States,
amebiasis
is
most
common
in:
People
who
have
traveled
to
tropical
places
that
have
poor
sanitary
conditions
Immigrants
from
tropical
countries
that
have
poor
sanitary
conditions
People
who
live
in
institutions
that
have
poor
sanitary
conditions
Men
who
have
sex
with
men
How
can
I
become
infected
with E.
histolytica?
histolytica
infection
can
occur
when
a
person:
Puts
anything
into
their
mouth
that
has
touched
the
feces
(poop)
of
a
person
who
is
infected
with E.
histolytica.
Swallows
something,
such
as
water
or
food,
that
is
contaminated
with E.
histolytica.
Swallows E.
histolytica cysts
(eggs)
picked
up
from
contaminated
surfaces
or
fingers.
What
are
the
symptoms
of
amebiasis?
Only
about
10%
to
20%
of
people
who
are
infected
with E.
histolytica become
sick
from
the
infection.
The
symptoms
are
often
quite
mild
and
can
include
loose
feces
(poop),
stomach
pain,
and
stomach
cramping.
Amebic
dysentery
is
a
severe
form
of
amebiasis
associated
with
stomach
pain,
bloody
stools
(poop),
and
fever.
Rarely, E.
histolytica invades
the
liver
and
forms
an
abscess
(a
collection
of
pus).
In
a
small
number
of
instances,
it
has
been
shown
to
spread
to
other
parts
of
the
body,
such
as
the
lungs
or
brain,
but
this
is
very
uncommon.
If
I
swallowed E.
histolytica,
how
quickly
would
I
become
sick?
Only
about
10%
to
20%
of
people
who
are
infected
with E.
histolytica become
sick
from
the
infection.
Those
people
who
do
become
sick
usually
develop
symptoms
within
2
to
4
weeks,
though
it
can
sometimes
take
longer.
What
should
I
do
if
I
think
I
have
amebiasis?
See
your
healthcare
provider.
How
is
amebiasis
diagnosed?
Your
healthcare
provider
will
ask
you
to
submit
fecal
(poop)
samples.
Because E.
histolytica is
not
always
found
in
every
stool
sample,
you
may
be
asked
to
submit
several
stool
samples
from
several
different
days.
Diagnosis
of
amebiasis
can
be
very
difficult.
One
problem
is
that
other
parasites
and
cells
can
look
very
similar
to E.
histolytica when
seen
under
a
microscope.
Therefore,
sometimes
people
are
told
that
they
are
infected
with E.
histolytica even
though
they
are
not. Entamoeba
histolytica and
another
ameba, Entamoeba
dispar,
which
is
about
10
times
more
common,
look
the
same
when
seen
under
a
microscope.
Unlike
infection
with E.
histolytica,
which
sometimes
makes
people
sick,
infection
with E.
dispar does
not
make
people
sick
and
therefore
does
not
need
to
be
treated.
If
you
have
been
told
that
you
are
infected
with E.
histolytica but
you
are
feeling
fine,
you
might
be
infected
with E.
dispar instead.
Unfortunately,
most
laboratories
do
not
yet
have
the
tests
that
can
tell
whether
a
person
is
infected
with E.
histolytica or
with E.
dispar. Until
these
tests
become
more
widely
available,
it
usually
is
best
to
assume
that
the
parasite
is E.
histolytica.
A
blood
test
is
also
available
but
is
only
recommended
when
your
healthcare
provider
thinks
that
your
infection
may
have
spread
beyond
the
intestine
(gut)
to
some
other
organ
of
your
body,
such
as
the
liver.
However,
this
blood
test
may
not
be
helpful
in
diagnosing
your
current
illness
because
the
test
can
be
positive
if
you
had
amebiasis
in
the
past,
even
if
you
are
not
infected
now.
How
is
amebiasis
treated?
Several
antibiotics
are
available
to
treat
amebiasis.
Treatment
must
be
prescribed
by
a
physician.
You
will
be
treated
with
only
one
antibiotic
if
your E.
histolytica infection
has
not
made
you
sick.
You
probably
will
be
treated
with
two
antibiotics
(first
one
and
then
the
other)
if
your
infection
has
made
you
sick.
I
am
going
to
travel
to
a
country
that
has
poor
sanitary
conditions.
What
should
I
eat
and
drink
there
so
I
will
NOT
become
infected
with E.
histolytica or
other
such
germs?
The
following
items
are
safe
to
drink:
Bottled
water
with
an
unbroken
seal
Tap
water
that
has
been
boiled
for
at
least
1
minute
Carbonated
(bubbly)
water
from
sealed
cans
or
bottles
Carbonated
(bubbly)
drinks
(like
soda)
from
sealed
cans
or
bottles
You
can
also
make
tap
water
safe
for
drinking
by
filtering
it
through
an
“absolute
1
micron
or
less”
filter
and
dissolving
chlorine,
chlorine
dioxide,
or
iodine
tablets
in
the
filtered
water.
“Absolute
1
micron”
filters
can
be
found
in
camping/outdoor
supply
stores.
For
more
information,
see
Personal
Preparation
and
Storage
of
Safe
Water
and
A
Guide
to
Water
Filters.
The
following
items
may
NOT
be
safe
to
drink
or
eat:
Fountain
drinks
or
any
drinks
with
ice
cubes
Fresh
fruit
or
vegetables
that
you
did
not
peel
yourself
Milk,
cheese,
or
dairy
products
that
may
not
have
been
pasteurized.
Food
or
drinks
sold
by
street
vendors
Should
I
be
concerned
about
spreading
the
infection
to
others?
Yes,
but
the
risk
of
spreading
infection
is
low
if
the
infected
person
is
treated
with
antibiotics
and
practices
good
personal
hygiene.
This
includes
thorough
handwashing
with
soap
and
water
after
using
the
toilet,
after
changing
diapers,
and
before
handling
or
preparing
food.

History
The
spectrum
of
intestinal
protozoal
infections
can
range
from
asymptomatic
to
invasive
disease
(in
the
cases
of
E
histolytica
or
B
coli)
to
severe
and/or
chronic
and
protracted
diarrhea
(in
the
cases
of
giardiasis
or
in
individuals
who
are
severely
immunosuppressed
with
spore-forming
protozoal
infections).
Amebiasis
Noninvasive
intestinal
infection:
Noninvasive
amebiasis
most
frequently
produces
no
symptoms.
Nevertheless,
some
patients
may
have
some
ill-defined
GI
tract
symptoms.
These
symptoms
include
alternating
periods
of
mild
diarrhea
and
constipation
with
or
without
mild
abdominal
pain;
however,
for
the
most
part,
patients
tolerate
the
infection.
Intestinal
amebiasis
or
amebic
colitis:
Patients
typically
have
1-3
weeks
of
diarrhea
to
grossly
bloody
dysenteric
stools
with
abdominal
pain.
Constitutional
symptoms
are
often
mild,
and
fever
is
present
only
in
about
10-20%
of
cases;
however,
weight
loss
is
common.
Some
patients
manifest
chronic
nondysenteric
diarrhea,
combined
with
months
or
even
years
of
abdominal
pain
associated
with
varying
amounts
of
flatulence,
mucus
in
stools,
and
weight
loss.
Acute
fulminant
or
necrotizing
colitis:
This
presentation
occurs
in
only
0.5%
of
intestinal
amebiasis
cases
and
has
been
associated
with
patients
inappropriately
treated
with
corticosteroids.
The
patient
develops
sudden
constipation
following
an
acute
and
severe
episode
of
dysenteric
diarrhea
that
is
followed
by
signs
of
shock.
Ameboma:
This
is
a
mass
of
granulation
tissue
in
the
cecum
or
ascending
colon,
and
it
usually
occurs
in
fewer
than
1%
of
patients
with
intestinal
amebiasis.
Concurrent
amebic
dysentery
is
present
in
two
thirds
of
patients.
Patients
usually
report
a
tender,
palpable,
lower-left
quadrant
abdominal
mass.
Liver
abscess:
This
occurs
in
10%
or
fewer
patients
with
invasive
E
histolytica
infections.
Patients
usually
have
a
history
of
more
than
1-2
weeks
of
fever,
abdominal
pain,
poor
appetite,
and,
less
commonly,
cough
and
pleuritic
chest
pain.
Liver
abscess
is
associated
with
diarrhea
only
in
20%
of
cases.
Jaundice
occurs
only
in
severe
cases.
Physical
See
the
list
below:
Amebic
or
balantidic
colitis
Most
patients
have
nonlocalized
abdominal
tenderness,
and
one
third
of
patients
have
fever
(usually
low-grade
fever).
Signs
of
dehydration
are
rare
with
these
pathogens,
although
they
can
be
present
in
young
infants.
An
ameboma
can
be
palpated
on
the
lower
right
abdominal
quadrant,
and
it
is
usually
tender
and
mobile.
Patients
with
acute
or
fulminant
colitis
present
with
severe
abdominal
pain,
distension,
and
rebound
tenderness,
with
or
without
fever.
The
patient
may
also
present
with
signs
of
shock.
In
patients
with
amebic
liver
abscess,
tender
hepatomegaly
is
present
in
almost
100%
of
cases,
and
fever
is
present
in
80-90%
of
cases,
with
or
without
hypoventilation
of
the
lower
right
lung.
Peritoneal
signs
and
jaundice
are
unusual
but,
when
present,
are
signs
of
severe
disease.
Giardiasis
In
children
younger
than
5
years,
acute
giardiasis
can
be
complicated
by
signs
of
dehydration
that
may
lead
to
hospitalization.
However,
these
events
are
not
as
prominent
as
with
other
enteropathogens,
such
as
rotavirus
or
enterotoxigenic
bacteria.
Signs
of
chronic
giardiasis
are
more
subtle.
The
patient
may
show
some
degree
of
protein-energy
malnutrition,
with
a
distended
abdomen
but
no
other
pathognomonic
signs.
Spore-forming
protozoa
In
immunocompetent
patients,
clinical
findings
are
no
different
than
the
findings
associated
with
giardiasis.
Signs
of
dehydration
are
unusual
but
can
occur.
In
immunodeficient
hosts,
especially
patients
with
AIDS,
diarrhea
has
been
associated
with
accompanying
signs
of
protein-energy
malnutrition
and
even
signs
of
hypokalemia
with
or
without
hyponatremia.
Some
patients
with
acute
exacerbations
can
also
manifest
acute
dehydration
with
or
without
metabolic
acidosis.
Dientamoebiasis
and
blastocystosis
Clinical
findings
of
dientamoebiasis
and
blastocystosis
are
no
different
than
those
found
with
acute
giardiasis,
although
signs
of
dehydration
are
less
frequent.
Some
immunosuppressed
patients
with
blastocystosis
may
present
with
signs
of
malnutrition,
but
these
observations
can
be
more
attributable
to
their
underlying
disease
than
to
the
parasitosis
itself.
Causes
See
the
list
below:
For
all
intestinal
protozoa,
fecal-oral
transmission
is
the
primary
route
of
transmission.
Water
and/or
food
contamination
contributes
to
most,
if
not
all,
individual
cases
and
outbreaks.
Immunologic
factors,
such
as
IgA
and
T-cell
responses,
are
important
for
giardiasis
and
spore-forming
protozoa.
Malnutrition
is
an
important
risk
factor
for
susceptibility
to
all
protozoa.
Swine
are,
by
far,
the
most
important
reservoir
for
balantidiasis.
Dientamoebiasis
is
frequently
associated
with
pinworm
co-infection.

A07.0,Balantidiasis,https://web.stanford.edu/group/parasites/ParaSites2003/Balantidium/Clinical_Presentation.htm,"Clinical
Presentation
of
Balantidiasis
Clinical
Presentation
of
Balantidiasis
Most
people
who
are
infected
with
Balantidium
coli
remain
asymptomatic.
An
infected
individual
may
have
cysts
or
trophozoites
in
their
feces,
but
be
free
of
any
other
symptoms
or
complaints
(See
Diagnosis).
Note:
consult
a
physician
if
you
suspect
you
have
Balantidiasis.
Although
Balantidium
coli
usually
resides
in
the
lumen
of
its
host,
trophozoites
can
invade
the
mucosa
of
the
large
intestine
(cecum
and
colon)
and
cause
ulcerations.
The
parasite
secretes
a
substance
called
hyaluronidase
enzyme,
which
helps
degrade
intestinal
tissue
and
facilitates
penetration
of
the
mucosa.
Other
bacteria
in
the
intestine
may
enter
the
ulcer
along
with
Balantidium
coli,
leading
to
secondary
infections.
Ulcerations
of
the
large
intestine
can
be
viewed
using
sigmoidoscopy
(See
Glossary).
Common
symptoms
of
Balantidiasis
include
chronic
diarrhea,
occasional
dysentery
(diarrhea
with
passage
of
blood
or
mucus),
nausea,
foul
breath,
colitis
(inflammation
of
the
colon),
abdominal
pain,
weight
loss,
deep
intestinal
ulcerations,
and
possibly
perforation
of
the
intestine.
Since
these
symptoms
are
non-specific
and
common
to
other
conditions
such
as
amebic
dysentery
or
amebiasis,
a
diagnosis
of
Balantidiasis
must
be
made
by
microscopic
examination
of
stool
or
tissue
sample
(See
Diagnosis).
Fulminating
acute
Balantidiasis
is
when
the
disease
comes
on
suddenly
and
with
great
intensity.
Left
untreated,
it
is
reported
to
have
a
case
fatality
rate
of
30%.
Dysentery
due
to
hemorrhaging
(bleeding)
can
lead
to
shock
and
death.
It
is
important
to
consider
what
other
health
conditions
a
patient
might
have
that
render
them
more
vulnerable
to
severe
Balantidiasis:
for
example,
other
intestinal
infections
or
parasites,
malnutrition,
alcoholism,
compromised
immunity,
or
a
history
of
chronic
disabling
diseases.
Infection
may
be
more
likely
and
symptoms
are
certainly
more
severe
in
debilitated
individuals.
Unfortunately,
poor
overall
health
is
a
common
trait
of
the
populations
most
affected
by
Balantidium
coli
(See
Epidemiology).
The
symptoms
described
are
for
the
acute
cases
that
appear
when
Balantidium
coli
is
invasive.
Most
infections
are
asymptomatic.
Still,
asymptomatic
individuals
can
transmit
the
disease,
which
highlights
the
importance
of
Public
Health
Interventions.
Incubation
period
After
ingestion
of
an
infective
Balantidium
coli
cyst,
days
to
weeks
may
pass
before
infection
occurs.

What
is
giardiasis?
Giardiasis
is
a
diarrheal
disease
caused
by
the
microscopic
parasite
Giardia
duodenalis
(or
“Giardia”
for
short).
Once
a
person
or
animal
has
been
infected
with
Giardia,
the
parasite
lives
in
the
intestines
and
is
passed
in
stool
(poop).
Once
outside
the
body,
Giardia
can
sometimes
survive
for
weeks
or
even
months.
Giardia
can
be
found
in
every
region
of
the
United
States
and
around
the
world.
Top

How
do
you
get
giardiasis
and
how
is
it
spread?
You
can
get
giardiasis
if
you
swallow
the
Giardia
parasite
(germ).
Giardia—or
poop
from
people
or
animals
infected
with
Giardia—can
contaminate
anything
it
touches.
Giardia
spreads
very
easily;
even
getting
tiny
amounts
of
poop
in
your
mouth
could
make
you
sick.
Giardiasis
can
be
spread
by:
Swallowing
unsafe
food
or
water
contaminated
with
Giardia
germs
Having
close
contact
with
someone
who
has
giardiasis,
particularly
in
childcare
settings
Traveling
within
areas
that
have
poor
sanitation
Exposure
to
poop
through
sexual
contact
from
someone
who
is
sick
or
recently
sick
with
Giardia
Transferring
Giardia
germs
picked
up
from
contaminated
surfaces
(such
as
bathroom
handles,
changing
tables,
diaper
pails,
or
toys)
into
your
mouth
Having
contact
with
infected
animals
or
animal
environments
contaminated
with
poop
Top

What
are
the
symptoms
of
giardiasis?
Giardia
infection
(giardiasis)
can
cause
a
variety
of
intestinal
symptoms,
which
include:
Diarrhea
Gas
Foul-smelling,
greasy
poop
that
can
float
Stomach
cramps
or
pain
Upset
stomach
or
nausea
Dehydration
Symptoms
of
giardiasis
generally
begin
by
having
2
to
5
loose
stools
(poop)
per
day
and
progressively
increasing
fatigue.
Other,
less
common
symptoms
include
fever,
itchy
skin,
hives,
and
swelling
of
the
eyes
and
joints.
Over
time,
giardiasis
can
also
cause
weight
loss
and
keep
the
body
from
absorbing
nutrients
it
needs,
like
fat,
lactose,
vitamin
A,
and
vitamin
B12.
Some
people
with
Giardia
infections
have
no
symptoms
at
all.
Top
of
Page
How
long
after
infection
do
symptoms
appear?
Symptoms
of
giardiasis
normally
begin
1
to
2
weeks
after
becoming
infected.
Top
of
Page
How
long
will
symptoms
last?
Symptoms
generally
last
anywhere
from
2
to
6
weeks.
In
people
with
weakened
immune
systems
(e.g.,
due
to
illness
such
as
HIV),
symptoms
may
last
longer.
Healthcare
providers
can
prescribe
the
appropriate
antiparasitic
medications
to
help
reduce
the
amount
of
time
symptoms
last.
Top

Page
Who
is
most
at
risk
of
getting
giardiasis?
Anyone
can
become
infected
with
Giardia.
However,
those
at
greatest
risk
are:
People
in
childcare
settings
People
who
are
in
close
contact
with
someone
who
has
the
disease
Travelers
within
areas
that
have
poor
sanitation
People
who
have
contact
with
poop
during
sexual
activity
Backpackers
or
campers
who
drink
untreated
water
from
springs,
lakes,
or
rivers
Swimmers
who
swallow
water
from
swimming
pools,
hot
tubs,
splash
pads,
or
untreated
recreational
water
from
springs,
lakes,
or
rivers
People
who
get
their
household
water
from
a
shallow
well
People
with
weakened
immune
systems
People
who
have
contact
with
infected
animals
or
animal
environments
contaminated
with
poop
Top

How
is
giardiasis
diagnosed?
Contact
your
healthcare
provider
if
you
think
you
may
have
giardiasis.
Your
healthcare
provider
will
ask
you
to
submit
stool
(poop)
samples
to
see
if
you
are
infected.
Because
it
can
be
difficult
to
detect
Giardia,
you
may
be
asked
to
submit
several
stool
specimens
collected
over
several
days
to
see
if
you
are
infected.
Top

What
is
the
treatment
for
giardiasis?
Many
prescription
drugs
are
available
to
treat
giardiasis.
Although
Giardia
can
infect
all
people,
infants
and
pregnant
women
may
be
more
likely
to
experience
dehydration
from
the
diarrhea
caused
by
giardiasis.
To
prevent
dehydration,
infants
and
pregnant
women
should
drink
a
lot
of
fluids
while
sick.
Dehydration
can
be
life-threatening
for
infants,
so
it
is
especially
important
that
parents
talk
to
their
healthcare
providers
about
treatment
options
for
their
infants.

My
child
does
not
have
diarrhea
but
was
recently
diagnosed
with
giardiasis.
My
healthcare
provider
says
treatment
is
not
necessary.
Is
this
correct?
Your
child
may
not
need
treatment
if
they
have
no
symptoms,
though
it
is
important
to
consider
that
their
poop
may
remain
a
source
of
infection
for
other
household
members
for
an
uncertain
period
of
time.
However,
if
your
child
does
not
have
diarrhea
but
does
have
other
symptoms,
such
as
nausea
or
upset
stomach,
tiredness,
weight
loss,
or
a
lack
of
hunger,
you
and
your
healthcare
provider
may
need
to
consider
treatment.
The
same
is
true
if
many
family
members
are
sick
or
if
a
family
member
is
pregnant
and
unable
to
take
the
most
effective
medications
to
treat
Giardia.
Contact
your
healthcare
provider
for
specific
treatment
recommendations.

Can
I
get
giardiasis
from
my
private
well?
Giardia-contaminated
poop
can
enter
ground
water
through
different
ways,
including
sewage
overflows,
sewage
systems
that
are
not
working
properly,
and
polluted
storm
water.
Wells
may
be
more
likely
to
be
contaminated
by
poop
after
flooding,
particularly
if
the
wells
are
shallow,
have
been
dug

What
can
I
do
to
prevent
and
control
giardiasis?
To
prevent
and
control
Giardia
infection,
it
is
important
to:
Wash
your
hands
with
soap
and
water
during
key
times,
especially:
before
preparing
food
or
eating,
and
after
using
the
bathroom
or
changing
diapers.
Avoid
eating
food
and
drinking
water
that
might
be
contaminated
with
Giardia
germs.
Properly
treat
water
from
springs,
lakes,
or
rivers
(surface
water)
while
backpacking
or
camping
if
no
other
source
of
safe
water
is
available.
Avoid
swallowing
water
from
swimming
pools,
hot
tubs,
splash
pads,
and
untreated
water
from
springs,
lakes,
or
rivers
(surface
water)
while
swimming.
Store,
clean,
and
prepare
fruits
and
vegetables
properly.
Practice
safe
sex
by
reducing
your
contact
with
poop
during
sex
or
avoid
having
sex
several
weeks
after
you
or
your
partner
have
recovered
from
giardiasis.

Can
I
get
giardiasis
from
my
pet?
The
chances
of
people
getting
a
Giardia
infection
from
dogs
or
cats
are
small.
The
type
of
Giardia
that
infects
humans
is
usually
not
the
same
type
that
infects
dogs
and
cats.

What
is
cryptosporidiosis?
Cryptosporidiosis
is
a
disease
that
causes
watery
diarrhea.
It
is
caused
by
microscopic
germs—parasites
called
Cryptosporidium.
Cryptosporidium,
or
“Crypto”
for
short,
can
be
found
in
water,
food,
soil
or
on
surfaces
or
dirty
hands
that
have
been
contaminated
with
the
feces
of
humans
or
animals
infected
with
the
parasite.
During
2001–2010,
Crypto
was
the
leading
cause
of
waterborne
disease
outbreaks,
linked
to
recreational
water
in
the
United
States.
The
parasite
is
found
in
every
region
of
the
United
States
and
throughout
the
world.
How
is
cryptosporidiosis
spread?
Crypto
lives
in
the
gut
of
infected
humans
or
animals.
An
infected
person
or
animal
sheds
Crypto
parasites
in
their
poop.
An
infected
person
can
shed
10,000,000
to
100,000,000
Crypto
germs
in
a
single
bowel
movement.
Shedding
of
Crypto
in
poop
begins
when
symptoms
like
diarrhea
begin
and
can
last
for
weeks
after
symptoms
stop.
Swallowing
as
few
as
10
Crypto
germs
can
cause
infection.
Crypto
can
be
spread
by:
Swallowing
recreational
water
(for
example,
the
water
in
swimming
pools,
fountains,
lakes,
rivers)
contaminated
with
Crypto
Crypto’s
high
tolerance
to
chlorine
enables
the
parasite
to
survive
for
long
periods
of
time
in
chlorinated
drinking
and
swimming
pool
water
Drinking
untreated
water
from
a
lake
or
river
that
is
contaminated
with
Crypto
Swallowing
water,
ice,
or
beverages
contaminated
with
poop
from
infected
humans
or
animals
Eating
undercooked
food
or
drinking
unpasteurized/raw
apple
cider
or
milk
that
gets
contaminated
with
Crypto
Touching
your
mouth
with
contaminated
hands
Hands
can
become
contaminated
through
a
variety
of
activities,
such
as
touching
surfaces
or
objects
(e.g.,
toys,
bathroom
fixtures,
changing
tables,
diaper
pails)
that
have
been
contaminated
by
poop
from
an
infected
person,
changing
diapers,
caring
for
an
infected
person,
and
touching
an
infected
animal
Exposure
to
poop
from
an
infected
person
through
oral-anal
sexual
contact
Crypto
is
not
spread
through
contact
with
blood.

What
are
the
symptoms
of
cryptosporidiosis,
when
do
they
begin,
and
how
long
do
they
last?
Symptoms
of
Crypto
generally
begin
2
to
10
days
(average
7
days)
after
becoming
infected
with
the
parasite.
Symptoms
include:
Watery
diarrhea
Stomach
cramps
or
pain
Dehydration
Nausea
Vomiting
Fever
Weight
loss
Symptoms
usually
last
about
1
to
2
weeks
(with
a
range
of
a
few
days
to
4
or
more
weeks)
in
people
with
healthy
immune
systems.
The
most
common
symptom
of
cryptosporidiosis
is
watery
diarrhea.
Some
people
with
Crypto
will
have
no
symptoms
at
all.

Who
is
most
at
risk
for
cryptosporidiosis?
People
who
are
most
likely
to
become
infected
with
Cryptosporidium
include
1,2:
Children
who
attend
childcare
centers,
including
diaper-aged
children
Childcare
workers
Parents
of
infected
children
Older
adults
(ages
75
years
and
older)
People
who
take
care
of
other
people
with
Crypto
International
travelers
Backpackers,
hikers,
and
campers
who
drink
unfiltered,
untreated
water
People
who
drink
from
untreated
shallow,
unprotected
wells
People,
including
swimmers,
who
swallow
water
from
contaminated
sources
People
who
handle
infected
calves
or
other
ruminants
like
sheep
People
exposed
to
human
poop
through
sexual
contact
Contaminated
water
might
include
water
that
has
not
been
boiled
or
filtered,
as
well
as
contaminated
recreational
water
sources
(e.g.,
swimming
pools,
lakes,
rivers,
ponds,
and
streams).
Several
community-wide
outbreaks
have
been
linked
to
drinking
tap
water
or
recreational
water
contaminated
with
Cryptosporidium.
Crypto’s
high
tolerance
to
chlorine
enables
the
parasite
to
survive
for
long
periods
of
time
in
chlorinated
drinking
and
swimming
pool
water.
This
means
anyone
swallowing
contaminated
water
could
get
ill.
For
more
information,
visit
Sources
of
Infection
&
Risk
Factors.
Note:
Although
Crypto
can
infect
all
people,
some
groups
are
likely
to
develop
more
serious
illness.
Young
children
and
pregnant
women
may
be
more
likely
to
get
dehydrated
because
of
their
diarrhea
so
they
should
drink
plenty
of
fluids
while
ill.
People
with
severely
weakened
immune
systems
are
at
risk
for
more
serious
disease.
Symptoms
may
be
more
severe
and
could
lead
to
serious
or
life-threatening
illness.
Examples
of
people
with
weakened
immune
systems
include
those
with
HIV/AIDS;
those
with
inherited
diseases
that
affect
the
immune
system;
and
cancer
and
transplant
patients
who
are
taking
certain
immunosuppressive
drugs.

What
should
I
do
if
I
think
I
might
have
cryptosporidiosis?
For
diarrhea
whose
cause
has
not
been
determined,
the
following
actions
may
help
relieve
symptoms:
Drink
plenty
of
fluids
to
remain
well
hydrated
and
avoid
dehydration.
Serious
health
problems
can
occur
if
the
body
does
not
maintain
proper
fluid
levels.
For
some
people,
diarrhea
can
be
severe
resulting
in
hospitalization
due
to
dehydration.
Maintain
a
well-balanced
diet.
Doing
so
may
help
speed
recovery.
Avoid
beverages
that
contain
caffeine,
such
as
tea,
coffee,
and
many
soft
drinks.
Avoid
alcohol,
as
it
can
lead
to
dehydration.
Contact
your
healthcare
provider
if
you
suspect
that
you
have
cryptosporidiosis.

How
is
cryptosporidiosis
diagnosed?
Cryptosporidiosis
is
a
diarrheal
disease
that
is
spread
through
contact
with
the
stool
of
an
infected
person
or
animal.
The
disease
is
diagnosed
by
examining
stool
samples.
People
infected
with
Crypto
can
shed
the
parasite
irregularly
in
their
poop
(for
example,
one
day
they
shed
parasite,
the
next
day
they
don’t,
the
third
day
they
do)
so
patients
may
need
to
give
three
samples
collected
on
three
different
days
to
help
make
sure
that
a
negative
test
result
is
accurate
and
really
means
they
do
not
have
Crypto.
Healthcare
providers
should
specifically
request
testing
for
Crypto.
Routine
ova
and
parasite
testing
does
not
normally
include
Crypto
testing.

What
is
the
treatment
for
cryptosporidiosis?
Most
people
with
healthy
immune
systems
will
recover
from
cryptosporidiosis
without
treatment.
The
following
actions
may
help
relieve
symptoms:
Drink
plenty
of
fluids
to
remain
well
hydrated
and
avoid
dehydration.
Serious
health
problems
can
occur
if
the
body
does
not
maintain
proper
fluid
levels.
For
some
people,
diarrhea
can
be
severe
resulting
in
hospitalization
due
to
dehydration.
Maintain
a
well-balanced
diet.
Doing
so
may
help
speed
recovery.
Avoid
beverages
that
contain
caffeine,
such
as
tea,
coffee,
and
many
soft
drinks.
Avoid
alcohol,
as
it
can
lead
to
dehydration.
Over-the-counter
anti-diarrheal
medicine
might
help
slow
down
diarrhea,
but
a
healthcare
provider
should
be
consulted
before
such
medicine
is
taken.
A
drug
called
nitazoxanide
has
been
FDA-approved
for
treatment
of
diarrhea
caused
by
Cryptosporidium
in
people
with
healthy
immune
systems
and
is
available
by
prescription.
Consult
with
your
healthcare
provider
for
more
information
about
potential
advantages
and
disadvantages
of
taking
nitazoxanide.
Individuals
who
have
health
concerns
should
talk
to
their
healthcare
provider.
For
more
information,
visit
Treatment.
Note:
Infants,
young
children,
and
pregnant
women
may
be
more
likely
than
others
to
suffer
from
dehydration.
Losing
a
lot
of
fluids
from
diarrhea
can
be
dangerous—and
especially
life-threatening
in
infants.
These
people
should
drink
extra
fluids
when
they
are
sick.
Severe
dehydration
may
require
hospitalization
for
treatment
with
fluids
given
through
your
vein
(intravenous
or
IV
fluids).
If
you
are
pregnant
or
a
parent
and
you
suspect
you
or
your
child
are
severely
dehydrated,
contact
a
healthcare
provider
about
fluid
replacement
options.

How
should
I
clean
my
house
to
help
prevent
the
spread
of
cryptosporidiosis?
No
cleaning
method
is
guaranteed
to
be
completely
effective
against
Crypto.
However,
you
can
lower
the
chance
of
spreading
Crypto
by
taking
the
following
precautions:
Wash
linens,
clothing,
dishwasher-
or
dryer-safe
soft
toys,
etc.
soiled
with
poop
or
vomit
as
soon
as
possible.
Flush
excess
vomit
or
poop
on
clothes
or
objects
down
the
toilet.
Use
laundry
detergent,
and
wash
in
hot
water:
113°F
or
hotter
for
at
least
20
minutes
or
at
122°F
or
hotter
for
at
least
5
minutes.
Machine

diaper-change
areas):
Remove
all
visible
poop.
Clean
with
soap
and
water.
Let
dry
completely
for
at
least
4
hours.
If
possible,
expose

the
4
hours.
Wash
your
hands
with
soap
and
water
after
cleaning
objects
or
surfaces
that
could
be
contaminated
with
Crypto.
Note:
The
best
way
to
prevent
the
spread
of
Cryptosporidium
in
the
home
is
by
practicing
good
hygiene.
Wash
your
hands
frequently

What
is
cystoisosporiasis?
In
what
areas
of
the
world
is
Cystoisospora
found?
How
do
people
become
infected
with
Cystoisospora?
Can
Cystoisospora
be
spread
directly
from
one
person
to
another?
What
are
the
symptoms
of
Cystoisospora
infection?
How
is
Cystoisospora
infection
diagnosed?
How
is
Cystoisospora
infection
treated?
How
can
Cystoisospora
infection
be
prevented?
What
is
cystoisosporiasis?
Cystoisosporiasis
is
an
intestinal
disease
caused
by
the
microscopic
parasite
Cystoisospora
belli.
This
is
the
same
parasite
that
used
to
be
called
Isospora
belli.
The
parasite
can
be
spread
by
ingesting
food
or
water
that
was
contaminated
with
feces
(stool)
from
an
infected
person.
In
what
areas
of
the
world
is
Cystoisospora
found?
Cystoisospora
can
be
found
worldwide.
It
is
most
common
in
tropical
and
subtropical
areas.
How
do
people
become
infected
with
Cystoisospora?
People
become
infected
by
swallowing
mature
parasites,
for
example,
by
ingesting
contaminated
food
or
water.
Infected
people
shed
the
immature
form
of
the
parasite
in
their
feces.
The
parasite
usually
needs
about
1
or
2
days
in
the
environment
(outside
of
people)
to
mature
enough
to
infect
someone
else.
In
some
settings,
the
parasite
might
mature
in
less
than
a
day.
Can
Cystoisospora
be
spread
directly
from
one
person
to
another?
Cystoisospora
usually
is
spread
indirectly,
such
as
through
contaminated
food
or
water.
This
is
because
the
parasite
needs
time
to
mature.
However,
oral-anal
contact
with
an
infected
person
might
pose
a
risk
for
transmission.
What
are
the
symptoms
of
Cystoisospora
infection?
The
most
common
symptom
is
watery
diarrhea.
Other
symptoms
can
include
abdominal
pain,
cramps,
loss
of
appetite,
nausea,
vomiting,
and
fever.
If
untreated,
people
with
weak
immune
systems,
such
as
people
with
AIDS,
may
be
at
higher
risk
for
severe
or
prolonged
illness.
How
is
Cystoisospora
infection
diagnosed?
Cystoisospora
is
too
small
to
be
seen
without
a
microscope.
The
infection
is
diagnosed
by
examining
stool
(fecal)
specimens
under
a
microscope.
More
than
one
specimen
may
need
to
be
examined
to
find
the
parasite.
How
is
Cystoisospora
infection
treated?
The
infection
is
treated
with
prescription
antibiotics.
The
usual
treatment
is
with
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole,
which
is
also
known
as
Bactrim*,
Septra*,
or
Cotrim*.
People
who
have
diarrhea
should
also
rest
and
drink
plenty
of
fluids.
How
can
Cystoisospora
infection
be
prevented?
Avoiding
food
or
water
that
might
be
contaminated
with
stool
may
help
prevent
infection.
As
always,
good
handwashing
and
personal-hygiene
practices
should
be
followed.
Wash
your
hands
with
soap
and
warm
water
after
using
the
toilet,
changing
diapers,
and
before
handling
food.
Teach
children
the
importance
of
washing
hands
to
prevent
infection.

History
The
spectrum
of
intestinal
protozoal
infections
can
range
from
asymptomatic
to
invasive
disease
(in
the
cases
of
E
histolytica
or
B
coli)
to
severe
and/or
chronic
and
protracted
diarrhea
(in
the
cases
of
giardiasis
or
in
individuals
who
are
severely
immunosuppressed
with
spore-forming
protozoal
infections).
Amebiasis
Noninvasive
intestinal
infection:
Noninvasive
amebiasis
most
frequently
produces
no
symptoms.
Nevertheless,
some
patients
may
have
some
ill-defined
GI
tract
symptoms.
These
symptoms
include
alternating
periods
of
mild
diarrhea
and
constipation
with
or
without
mild
abdominal
pain;
however,
for
the
most
part,
patients
tolerate
the
infection.
Intestinal
amebiasis
or
amebic
colitis:
Patients
typically
have
1-3
weeks
of
diarrhea
to
grossly
bloody
dysenteric
stools
with
abdominal
pain.
Constitutional
symptoms
are
often
mild,
and
fever
is
present
only
in
about
10-20%
of
cases;
however,
weight
loss
is
common.
Some
patients
manifest
chronic
nondysenteric
diarrhea,
combined
with
months
or
even
years
of
abdominal
pain
associated
with
varying
amounts
of
flatulence,
mucus
in
stools,
and
weight
loss.
Acute
fulminant
or
necrotizing
colitis:
This
presentation
occurs
in
only
0.5%
of
intestinal
amebiasis
cases
and
has
been
associated
with
patients
inappropriately
treated
with
corticosteroids.
The
patient
develops
sudden
constipation
following
an
acute
and
severe
episode
of
dysenteric
diarrhea
that
is
followed
by
signs
of
shock.
Ameboma:
This
is
a
mass
of
granulation
tissue
in
the
cecum
or
ascending
colon,
and
it
usually
occurs
in
fewer
than
1%
of
patients
with
intestinal
amebiasis.
Concurrent
amebic
dysentery
is
present
in
two
thirds
of
patients.
Patients
usually
report
a
tender,
palpable,
lower-left
quadrant
abdominal
mass.
Liver
abscess:
This
occurs
in
10%
or
fewer
patients
with
invasive
E
histolytica
infections.
Patients
usually
have
a
history
of
more
than
1-2
weeks
of
fever,
abdominal
pain,
poor
appetite,
and,
less
commonly,
cough
and
pleuritic
chest
pain.
Liver
abscess
is
associated
with
diarrhea
only
in
20%
of
cases.
Jaundice
occurs
only
in
severe
cases.
Physical
See
the
list
below:
Amebic
or
balantidic
colitis
Most
patients
have
nonlocalized
abdominal
tenderness,
and
one
third
of
patients
have
fever
(usually
low-grade
fever).
Signs
of
dehydration
are
rare
with
these
pathogens,
although
they
can
be
present
in
young
infants.
An
ameboma
can
be
palpated
on
the
lower
right
abdominal
quadrant,
and
it
is
usually
tender
and
mobile.
Patients
with
acute
or
fulminant
colitis
present
with
severe
abdominal
pain,
distension,
and
rebound
tenderness,
with
or
without
fever.
The
patient
may
also
present
with
signs
of
shock.
In
patients
with
amebic
liver
abscess,
tender
hepatomegaly
is
present
in
almost
100%
of
cases,
and
fever
is
present
in
80-90%
of
cases,
with
or
without
hypoventilation
of
the
lower
right
lung.
Peritoneal
signs
and
jaundice
are
unusual
but,
when
present,
are
signs
of
severe
disease.
Giardiasis
In
children
younger
than
5
years,
acute
giardiasis
can
be
complicated
by
signs
of
dehydration
that
may
lead
to
hospitalization.
However,
these
events
are
not
as
prominent
as
with
other
enteropathogens,
such
as
rotavirus
or
enterotoxigenic
bacteria.
Signs
of
chronic
giardiasis
are
more
subtle.
The
patient
may
show
some
degree
of
protein-energy
malnutrition,
with
a
distended
abdomen
but
no
other
pathognomonic
signs.
Spore-forming
protozoa
In
immunocompetent
patients,
clinical
findings
are
no
different
than
the
findings
associated
with
giardiasis.
Signs
of
dehydration
are
unusual
but
can
occur.
In
immunodeficient
hosts,
especially
patients
with
AIDS,
diarrhea
has
been
associated
with
accompanying
signs
of
protein-energy
malnutrition
and
even
signs
of
hypokalemia
with
or
without
hyponatremia.
Some
patients
with
acute
exacerbations
can
also
manifest
acute
dehydration
with
or
without
metabolic
acidosis.
Dientamoebiasis
and
blastocystosis
Clinical
findings
of
dientamoebiasis
and
blastocystosis
are
no
different
than
those
found
with
acute
giardiasis,
although
signs
of
dehydration
are
less
frequent.
Some
immunosuppressed
patients
with
blastocystosis
may
present
with
signs
of
malnutrition,
but
these
observations
can
be
more
attributable
to
their
underlying
disease
than
to
the
parasitosis
itself.
Causes
See
the
list
below:
For
all
intestinal
protozoa,
fecal-oral
transmission
is
the
primary
route
of
transmission.
Water
and/or
food
contamination
contributes
to
most,
if
not
all,
individual
cases
and
outbreaks.
Immunologic
factors,
such
as
IgA
and
T-cell
responses,
are
important
for
giardiasis
and
spore-forming
protozoa.
Malnutrition
is
an
important
risk
factor
for
susceptibility
to
all
protozoa.
Swine
are,
by
far,
the
most
important
reservoir
for
balantidiasis.
Dientamoebiasis
is
frequently
associated
with
pinworm
co-infection.

History
The
spectrum
of
intestinal
protozoal
infections
can
range
from
asymptomatic
to
invasive
disease
(in
the
cases
of
E
histolytica
or
B
coli)
to
severe
and/or
chronic
and
protracted
diarrhea
(in
the
cases
of
giardiasis
or
in
individuals
who
are
severely
immunosuppressed
with
spore-forming
protozoal
infections).
Amebiasis
Noninvasive
intestinal
infection:
Noninvasive
amebiasis
most
frequently
produces
no
symptoms.
Nevertheless,
some
patients
may
have
some
ill-defined
GI
tract
symptoms.
These
symptoms
include
alternating
periods
of
mild
diarrhea
and
constipation
with
or
without
mild
abdominal
pain;
however,
for
the
most
part,
patients
tolerate
the
infection.
Intestinal
amebiasis
or
amebic
colitis:
Patients
typically
have
1-3
weeks
of
diarrhea
to
grossly
bloody
dysenteric
stools
with
abdominal
pain.
Constitutional
symptoms
are
often
mild,
and
fever
is
present
only
in
about
10-20%
of
cases;
however,
weight
loss
is
common.
Some
patients
manifest
chronic
nondysenteric
diarrhea,
combined
with
months
or
even
years
of
abdominal
pain
associated
with
varying
amounts
of
flatulence,
mucus
in
stools,
and
weight
loss.
Acute
fulminant
or
necrotizing
colitis:
This
presentation
occurs
in
only
0.5%
of
intestinal
amebiasis
cases
and
has
been
associated
with
patients
inappropriately
treated
with
corticosteroids.
The
patient
develops
sudden
constipation
following
an
acute
and
severe
episode
of
dysenteric
diarrhea
that
is
followed
by
signs
of
shock.
Ameboma:
This
is
a
mass
of
granulation
tissue
in
the
cecum
or
ascending
colon,
and
it
usually
occurs
in
fewer
than
1%
of
patients
with
intestinal
amebiasis.
Concurrent
amebic
dysentery
is
present
in
two
thirds
of
patients.
Patients
usually
report
a
tender,
palpable,
lower-left
quadrant
abdominal
mass.
Liver
abscess:
This
occurs
in
10%
or
fewer
patients
with
invasive
E
histolytica
infections.
Patients
usually
have
a
history
of
more
than
1-2
weeks
of
fever,
abdominal
pain,
poor
appetite,
and,
less
commonly,
cough
and
pleuritic
chest
pain.
Liver
abscess
is
associated
with
diarrhea
only
in
20%
of
cases.
Jaundice
occurs
only
in
severe
cases.
Physical
See
the
list
below:
Amebic
or
balantidic
colitis
Most
patients
have
nonlocalized
abdominal
tenderness,
and
one
third
of
patients
have
fever
(usually
low-grade
fever).
Signs
of
dehydration
are
rare
with
these
pathogens,
although
they
can
be
present
in
young
infants.
An
ameboma
can
be
palpated
on
the
lower
right
abdominal
quadrant,
and
it
is
usually
tender
and
mobile.
Patients
with
acute
or
fulminant
colitis
present
with
severe
abdominal
pain,
distension,
and
rebound
tenderness,
with
or
without
fever.
The
patient
may
also
present
with
signs
of
shock.
In
patients
with
amebic
liver
abscess,
tender
hepatomegaly
is
present
in
almost
100%
of
cases,
and
fever
is
present
in
80-90%
of
cases,
with
or
without
hypoventilation
of
the
lower
right
lung.
Peritoneal
signs
and
jaundice
are
unusual
but,
when
present,
are
signs
of
severe
disease.
Giardiasis
In
children
younger
than
5
years,
acute
giardiasis
can
be
complicated
by
signs
of
dehydration
that
may
lead
to
hospitalization.
However,
these
events
are
not
as
prominent
as
with
other
enteropathogens,
such
as
rotavirus
or
enterotoxigenic
bacteria.
Signs
of
chronic
giardiasis
are
more
subtle.
The
patient
may
show
some
degree
of
protein-energy
malnutrition,
with
a
distended
abdomen
but
no
other
pathognomonic
signs.
Spore-forming
protozoa
In
immunocompetent
patients,
clinical
findings
are
no
different
than
the
findings
associated
with
giardiasis.
Signs
of
dehydration
are
unusual
but
can
occur.
In
immunodeficient
hosts,
especially
patients
with
AIDS,
diarrhea
has
been
associated
with
accompanying
signs
of
protein-energy
malnutrition
and
even
signs
of
hypokalemia
with
or
without
hyponatremia.
Some
patients
with
acute
exacerbations
can
also
manifest
acute
dehydration
with
or
without
metabolic
acidosis.
Dientamoebiasis
and
blastocystosis
Clinical
findings
of
dientamoebiasis
and
blastocystosis
are
no
different
than
those
found
with
acute
giardiasis,
although
signs
of
dehydration
are
less
frequent.
Some
immunosuppressed
patients
with
blastocystosis
may
present
with
signs
of
malnutrition,
but
these
observations
can
be
more
attributable
to
their
underlying
disease
than
to
the
parasitosis
itself.
Causes
See
the
list
below:
For
all
intestinal
protozoa,
fecal-oral
transmission
is
the
primary
route
of
transmission.
Water
and/or
food
contamination
contributes
to
most,
if
not
all,
individual
cases
and
outbreaks.
Immunologic
factors,
such
as
IgA
and
T-cell
responses,
are
important
for
giardiasis
and
spore-forming
protozoa.
Malnutrition
is
an
important
risk
factor
for
susceptibility
to
all
protozoa.
Swine
are,
by
far,
the
most
important
reservoir
for
balantidiasis.
Dientamoebiasis
is
frequently
associated
with
pinworm
co-infection.

coli.
E.
coli
bacteria
are
found
in
the
intestines
of
people
and
animals.
Most
varieties
are
harmless,
but
some
strains
—
such
as
E.
coli
O157:H7
—
secrete
a
toxin
that
can
cause
abdominal
cramps,
vomiting,
and
bloody
diarrhea.
E.
coli
spread
through
contaminated
water
or
food
that
came
into
contact
with
animal
manure.
E.
coli
can

person-to-person
contact.Salmonella.
Salmonella
infection
is
commonly
caused
by
eating
raw
or
undercooked
poultry,
meat,
and
eggs.
The
majority
of
salmonella
infections
can
be
classified
as
gastroenteritis.ViralNorovirus.
Noroviruses
are
the
most
common
cause
of
foodborne
illness
worldwide.
It’s
especially
likely
to
spread
among
people
in
confined
spaces.
Although
in
most
cases
the
virus
is
spread
through
contaminated
food
or
water,
person-to-person
transmission
is
also
possible.Rotavirus.
According
to
the
Mayo
Clinic,
rotavirus
is
the
leading
cause
of
viral
gastroenteritis
in
children
worldwide.
Children
are
commonly
infected
when
they
touch
objects
contaminated
with
the
virus
and
then
put
their
fingers
in
their
mouths.
There’s
a
rotavirus
vaccine
available
in
some
countries.ParasiteGiardiasis.
Giardia
is
a
parasite
that
spreads
easily
through
human
contact
and
contaminated
water.
It’s
resistant
to
chlorine
and
can
spread
in
public
swimming
pools.
Infection
can
occur
from
drinking
water
from
and
bathing
in
contaminated
lakes
and
streams.Cryptosporidiosis.
A
leading
cause

for

cases,
self-care
measures
are
the
recommended
treatment.
Antibiotics

not
help
GI
infections
from
viruses
or
parasites.Although
antibiotics
can
help
with
complicated
cases
of

infection,
in
uncomplicated
cases,
antibiotics
may
actually
prolong

and
increase

in
certain
infections,
antibiotics
may
lead
to
dangerous
complications.
Your
doctor
can
help
determine
if
you
or
your
child
need
antibiotics.Your
doctor
might
recommend
that
you
stay
away
from
high-fiber
foods
that
could
make
diarrhea
worse.
They
might
also
recommend
over-the-counter
medications
that
neutralize

or
that
treat
nausea,
abdominal
pain,
and
diarrhea.The
most
important
self-care
treatment
for

The
most
common
symptoms
of
rotavirus
are
severe
watery
diarrhea,
vomiting,
fever,
and/or
abdominal
pain.
Symptoms
usually
start
about
two
days
after
a
person
is
exposed
to
rotavirus.
Vomiting
and
watery
diarrhea
can
last
three
to
eight
days.
Additional
symptoms
may
include
loss
of
appetite
and
dehydration
(loss
of
body
fluids),
which
can
be
especially
dangerous
for
infants
and
young
children.
Symptoms
of
dehydration
include:
decreased
urination
dry
mouth
and
throat
feeling
dizzy
when
standing
up
crying
with
few
or
no
tears
and
unusual
sleepiness
or
fussiness.
Rotavirus
disease
is
most
common
in
infants
and
young
children.
However,
older
children
and
adults
can
also get
sick
from
rotavirus.
Adults
who
get
rotavirus
disease
tend
to
have
milder
symptoms.

OverviewNorovirus
infection
can
cause
the
sudden
onset
of
severe
vomiting
and
diarrhea.
The
virus
is
highly
contagious
and
commonly
spread
through
food
or
water
that
is
contaminated
during
preparation
or
through
contaminated
surfaces.
You
can
also
be
infected
through
close
contact
with
an
infected
person.
Diarrhea,
stomach
pain
and
vomiting
typically
begin
12
to
48
hours
after
exposure.
Norovirus
symptoms
usually
last
one
to
three
days,
and
most
people
recover
completely
without
treatment.
However,
for
some
people
—
especially
infants,
older
adults
and
people
with
underlying
disease
—
vomiting
and
diarrhea
can
be
severely
dehydrating
and
require
medical
attention.
Norovirus
infection
occurs
most
frequently
in
closed
and
crowded
environments
such
as
hospitals,
nursing
homes,
child
care
centers,
schools
and
cruise
ships.Products

SymptomsSigns
and
symptoms
of
norovirus
infection
include:
Nausea
Vomiting
Stomach
pain
or
cramps
Watery
or
loose
diarrhea
Feeling
ill
Low-grade
fever
Muscle
pain
Signs
and
symptoms
usually
begin
12
to
48
hours
after
exposure
to
norovirus
and
last
one
to
three
days.
You
can
continue
to
shed
virus
in
your
feces
for
up
to
two
weeks
after
recovery.
This
shedding
can
last
weeks
to
months
if
you
have
an
underlying
health
condition.
Some
people
with
norovirus
infection
show
no
signs
or
symptoms.
However,
they
are
still
contagious
and
can
spread
the
virus
to
others.
When
to
see
a
doctorSeek
medical
attention
if
you
develop
diarrhea
that
doesn't
go
away
within
several
days.
Also,
call
your
doctor
if
you
have
severe
vomiting,
bloody
stools,
stomach
pain
or
dehydration.

Mayo

CausesNoroviruses
are
highly
contagious
and
are
shed
in
the
feces
of
infected
humans
and
animals.
You
can
get
norovirus
by:
Eating
contaminated
food
Drinking
contaminated
water
Touching
your
hand
to
your
mouth
after
your
hand
has
been
in
contact
with
a
contaminated
surface
or
object
Being
in
close
contact
with
a
person
who
has
a
norovirus
infection
Noroviruses
are
difficult
to
kill
off
because
they
can
withstand
hot
and
cold
temperatures
and
most
disinfectants.
Risk
factorsRisk
factors
for
becoming
infected
with
norovirus
include:
Eating
in
a
place
where
food
is
handled
improperly
Attending
preschool
or
a
child
care
center
Living
in
close
quarters,
such
as
in
nursing
homes
Staying
in
hotels,
resorts,
cruise
ships
or
other
destinations
with
many
people
in
close
quarters
Having
contact
with
someone
who
has
norovirus
infection
ComplicationsFor
most
people,
norovirus
infection
usually
clears
up
within
a
few
days
and
isn't
life-threatening.
But
in
some
people
—
especially
children,
older
adults
and
people
with
compromised
immune
systems
—
norovirus
infection
can
cause
dehydration.
Norovirus
infection
can
cause
severe
dehydration,
malnutrition
and
even
death,
especially
in
people
who
are
older
or
immunocompromised,
or
in
women
who
are
pregnant.
Warning
signs
of
dehydration
include:
Fatigue
Dry
mouth
and
throat
Listlessness
Dizziness
Decreased
urine
output
Children
who
are
dehydrated
might
cry
with
few
or
no
tears.
They
might
be
unusually
sleepy
or
fussy.
PreventionNorovirus
infection
is
highly
contagious,
and
anyone
can
become
infected
more
than
once.
To
help
prevent
its
spread:
Wash
your
hands
thoroughly
with
soap
and
water,
especially
after
using
the
toilet
or
changing
a
diaper.
Avoid
contaminated
food
and
water,
including
food
that
could
have
been
prepared
by
someone
who
was
sick.
Wash
fruits
and
vegetables
before
eating.
Cook
seafood
thoroughly.
Dispose
of
vomit
and
fecal
matter
carefully
to
avoid
spreading
norovirus
by
air.
Soak
up
material
with
disposable
towels,
disturbing
it
as
little
as
possible,
and
place
it
in
plastic
disposable
bags.
Disinfect
surfaces
that
might
have
been
contaminated.
Use
a
chlorine
bleach
solution
and
wear
gloves.
Stay
home
from
work,
especially
if
your
job
involves
handling
food.
You
might
be
contagious
for
as
long
as
three
days
after
your
symptoms
end.
Children
should
stay
home
from
school
or
child
care.
Avoid
traveling
until
your
signs
and
symptoms
are
gone.

What
is
viral
gastroenteritis?
Viral
gastroenteritis
is
an
inflammation,
swelling,
and
irritation
of
the
inside
lining
of
your
gastrointestinal
tract.
A
virus
causes
this
illness.
It
can
infect
your
stomach,
small
intestine,
and
large
intestine.
Viral
gastroenteritis
is
very
common.
In
most
cases,
it
lasts
only
a
few
days
and
doesn’t
require
treatment.
The
biggest
danger
is
dehydration
from
loss
of
fluid
due
to
diarrhea
and
vomiting.
What
causes
viral
gastroenteritis?
Several
viruses
can
cause
gastroenteritis.
Viruses
can
be
found
in
the
vomit
and
the
diarrhea
of
infected
people.
It
can
live
for
a
long
time
outside
the
body.
People
who
are
infected
can
spread
the
virus
to
objects
they
touch,
especially
if
they
don’t
wash
their
hands
after
using
the
bathroom.
Food
workers
with
the
infection
can
spread
it
to
others
through
food
and
beverages.
Sewage
that
gets
into
the
water
supply
can
also
spread
the
illness.
Although
viral
gastroenteritis
is
sometimes
called
""stomach
flu,""
the
seasonal
influenza
(flu)
virus
does
not
cause
it.
Some
of
the
common
viruses
that
cause
gastroenteritis
include:
Rotavirus.
This
virus
most
commonly
infects
infants
age
3
to
15
months.
The
illness
lasts
for
3
to
7
days
and
is
most
common
in
fall
and
winter.
Norovirus.
This
virus
is
the
most
common
cause
of
adult
infections,
and
it’s
usually
responsible
for
outbreaks
on
cruise
ships.
Symptoms
last
from
1
to
3
days
and
can
occur
any
time
of
the
year.
Adenovirus.
This
virus
occurs
year-round
and
affects
children
age
2
and
younger.
Symptoms
last
from
5
to
12
days.
Many
other
viruses
can
also
cause
viral
gastroenteritis.
What
are
the
symptoms
of
viral
gastroenteritis?
Symptoms
of
viral
gastroenteritis
usually
begin
about
1
to
2
days
after
the
virus
gets
into
the
body.
Common
symptoms
include:
Nausea
Vomiting
Watery
diarrhea
Other
possible
symptoms
are:
Headache
Fever
Chills
Stomachache
Signs
of
dehydration:
Decreased
urine
output
Dark-colored
urine
Dry
skin
Thirst
Dizziness
Signs
of
dehydration
in
young
children:
Dry
diapers
(from
a
lack
of
urination)
Lack
of
tears
Dry
mouth
Drowsiness
Sunken
fontanel
(the
soft
spot
on
the
top
of
an
infant’s
head)
How
is
viral
gastroenteritis
diagnosed?
Your
healthcare
provider
will
most
likely
diagnose
your
condition
based
on
your
history
and
symptoms.
You
will
rarely
need
testing.
If
your
symptoms
persist,
your
healthcare
provider
may
ask
for
a
stool
sample
to
look
for
viruses,
bacteria,
and
parasites.
Can
viral
gastroenteritis
be
prevented?
Vaccines
are
available
to
protect
children
from
rotavirus.
Healthcare
providers
give
shots
to
babies
before
age
6
months.
You
and
your
children
can
help
prevent
viral
gastroenteritis
by
taking
these
steps:
Wash
hands
for
20
seconds
with
soap
and
water
after
going
to
the
bathroom,
after
changing
a
diaper,
and
before
touching
any
food.
Use
alcohol-based
sanitizers.
If
someone
in
the
house
has
gastroenteritis,
wash
all
surfaces
that
might
be
contaminated
with
a
bleach-based
cleaner.
Don't
eat
or
drink
any
food
or
water
with
warnings
of
contamination.
How
is
viral
gastroenteritis
treated?
Specific
treatment
is
usually
not
needed.
In
most
cases,
you
simply
need
to
drink
plenty
of
fluids
and
rest
at
home
until
the
virus
leaves
your
system.
In
rare
cases,
you
may
need
treatment
for
severe
dehydration
with
IV
(intravenous)
fluids.
Helpful
home
care
tips
include:
Drink
plenty
of
light
fluids
like
water,
ice
chips,
fruit
juice,
and
broth.
Keep
in
mind
that
sports
drinks
are
high
in
sugar
and
are
not
appropriate
if
you
are
extremely
dehydrated.
In
this
case,
you
will
need
an
oral
rehydration
solution.
Don't
have
drinks
that
contain
milk,
caffeine,
or
alcohol.
Once
you
feel
hungry
again,
start
with
mild,
easy
to
digest
foods.
Rehydrate
children
with
oral
rehydration
solutions.
You
may
take
antidiarrheal
medicines
for
a
couple
days.
But
don't
take
these
if
you
have
a
fever
or
bloody
stool.
Don't
take
them
if
you
are
an
elderly
adult.
Don't
give
these
to
a
child.
When
should
I
call
my
healthcare
provider?
Viral
gastroenteritis
is
common
in
children
and
adults.
In
most
cases,
the
disease
is
not
serious
and
will
run
its
course
in
a
few
days.
Call
your
healthcare
provider
if
you
or
a
family
member
has
vomiting
or
diarrhea
that’s
not
getting
better,
if
you
see
blood
or
tar-like
stool,
or
if
you
have
any
signs
of
dehydration.

points
about
viral
gastroenteritis

What
Causes
Gastroenteritis?
Gastroenteritis
Treatment
When
you
have
diarrhea
and
vomiting,
you
may
say
you
have
the
""stomach
flu.""
These
symptoms
often
are
due
to
a
condition
called
gastroenteritis.With
gastroenteritis,
your
stomach
and
intestines
are
irritated
and
inflamed.
The
cause
is
typically
a
viral
or
bacterial
infection.Symptoms
of
GastroenteritisWith
gastroenteritis,
the
main
symptoms
you
probably
have
are
watery
diarrhea
and
vomiting.
You
might
also
have
stomach
pain,
cramping,
fever,
nausea,
and
a
headache.Because
of
diarrhea
and
vomiting,
you
also
can
become
dehydrated.
Watch
for
signs
of
dehydration,
such
as
dry
skin
and
a
dry
mouth,
feeling
lightheaded,
and
being
really
thirsty.
Call
your
doctor
if
you
have
any
of
these
symptoms.Stomach
Flu
and
ChildrenChildren
can
get
dehydrated
quickly,
so
if
your
child
has
the
stomach
flu,
it's
important
that
you
look
for
signs
that
they
are very
thirsty
or
has
dry
skin
or
a
dry
mouth.
If
you
have
a
baby,
look
for
fewer,
drier
diapers.Keep
children
with
gastroenteritis
out
of
day
care
or
school
until
all
symptoms
are
gone.
Check
with
your
doctor
before
giving
your
child
any
medicine.
Drugs
used
to
control
diarrhea
and
vomiting
aren't
usually
given
to
children
younger
than
5.To
help
prevent
rotavirus
--
the
most
common
cause
of
stomach
flu
for
children
--
there
are
two
vaccines
that
can
be
given
to
infants.
Talk
to
your
doctor
about
the
vaccines.What
Causes
Gastroenteritis?There
are
many
ways
gastroenteritis
can
be
spread:Contact
with
someone
who
has
the
virusContaminated
food
or
waterUnwashed
hands
after
going
to
the
bathroom
or
changing
a
diaperThe
most
common
cause
of
gastroenteritis
is
a
virus. The
main
types
are
rotavirus
and
norovirus.Rotavirus
is
the
world's
most
common
cause
of
diarrhea
in
infants
and
young
children.
Norovirus
is
the
most
common
cause
of
serious
gastroenteritis
and
also
foodborne
disease
outbreaks
in
the
U.S.Although
not
as
common,
bacteria
such
as
E.
coli
and
salmonella
can
also
trigger
the
stomach
flu.
Salmonella
and
campylobacter
bacteria
are
the
most
common
bacterial
causes
of
gastroenteritis
in
the
U.S.
and
are
usually
spread
by
undercooked
poultry,
eggs,
or
poultry
juices.
Salmonella
can
also
be
spread
through
pet
reptiles
or
live
poultry.
Another
bacteria,
shigella,
is
often
passed
around
in
day
care
centers.
It
typically
is
spread
from
person
to
person,
and
common
sources
of
infection
are
contaminated
food
and
drinking
water.
Parasites
can
also
cause
gastroenteritis,
but
it's
not
common.
You
can
pick
up
organisms
such
as
giardia
and
cryptosporidium
in
contaminated
swimming
pools
or
by
drinking
contaminated
water.There
are
also
other
unusual
ways
to
get
gastroenteritis:Heavy
metals
(arsenic,
cadmium,
lead,
or
mercury)
in
drinking
waterEating
a
lot
of
acidic
foods,
like
citrus
fruit
and
tomatoesToxins
that
might
be
found
in
certain
seafoodMedications
such
as
antibiotics,
antacids,
laxatives,
and
chemotherapy
drugsGastroenteritis
TreatmentPrevent
dehydration:Give
a
child
an
oral
rehydration
solution.
Call
your
doctor
for
age-appropriate
dosing
specifics.Give
an
adult
as
much
clear
fluid
as
possible.The
person
should
drink
fluids
slowly
in
frequent,
small
amounts.
Drinking
too
much
too
fast
can
make
nausea
worse.As
symptoms
start
to
ease:Gradually
ease
food
back
into
the
person's
diet.Start
with
bland,
easy-to-digest
food
such
as
crackers,
bananas,
toast,
rice,
and
chicken.Avoid
dairy,

coli.
E.
coli
bacteria
are
found
in
the
intestines
of
people
and
animals.
Most
varieties
are
harmless,
but
some
strains
—
such
as
E.
coli
O157:H7
—
secrete
a
toxin
that
can
cause
abdominal
cramps,
vomiting,
and

diarrhea.
E.
coli
spread
through
contaminated
water
or
food
that
came
into
contact
with

person-to-person
contact.Salmonella.
Salmonella
infection
is
commonly
caused
by
eating
raw
or
undercooked
poultry,
meat,
and
eggs.
The
majority
of
salmonella
infections
can
be
classified
as
gastroenteritis.ViralNorovirus.
Noroviruses
are
the
most
common
cause
of
foodborne
illness
worldwide.
It’s
especially
likely
to
spread
among
people
in
confined
spaces.
Although
in
most
cases
the
virus
is
spread
through
contaminated
food
or
water,
person-to-person
transmission
is
also
possible.Rotavirus.
According
to
the
Mayo
Clinic,
rotavirus
is
the
leading
cause
of
viral
gastroenteritis
in
children
worldwide.
Children
are
commonly
infected
when
they
touch
objects
contaminated
with
the
virus
and
then
put
their
fingers
in
their
mouths.
There’s
a
rotavirus
vaccine
available
in
some
countries.ParasiteGiardiasis.
Giardia
is
a
parasite
that
spreads
easily
through
human
contact
and
contaminated
water.
It’s
resistant
to
chlorine
and
can
spread
in
public
swimming
pools.
Infection
can
occur
from
drinking
water
from
and
bathing
in
contaminated
lakes
and
streams.Cryptosporidiosis.
A
leading
cause
of
waterborne
disease
in
the
United
States,
Cryptosporidium
is
a
microscopic
parasite
which
causes

It
has
an

may

to
dangerous
complications.
Your

doctor
might
recommend
that
you
stay
away
from
high-fiber
foods
that
could
make

diarrhea
and
vomiting,

may
say
you
have
the
""stomach
flu.""
These
symptoms
often
are
due
to
a
condition
called
gastroenteritis.With
gastroenteritis,
your
stomach
and
intestines
are
irritated
and
inflamed.
The
cause
is
typically
a
viral
or
bacterial
infection.Symptoms
of
GastroenteritisWith
gastroenteritis,
the
main
symptoms
you
probably
have
are
watery
diarrhea
and
vomiting.
You
might
also
have
stomach
pain,
cramping,
fever,
nausea,
and
a
headache.Because
of
diarrhea
and
vomiting,
you
also
can
become
dehydrated.
Watch
for
signs
of
dehydration,
such
as
dry
skin
and
a
dry
mouth,
feeling
lightheaded,
and
being
really
thirsty.
Call
your
doctor
if
you
have
any
of
these
symptoms.Stomach
Flu
and
ChildrenChildren
can
get
dehydrated
quickly,
so
if
your
child
has
the
stomach
flu,
it's
important
that
you
look
for
signs
that
they
are very
thirsty
or
has
dry
skin
or
a
dry
mouth.
If
you
have
a
baby,
look
for
fewer,
drier
diapers.Keep
children
with
gastroenteritis
out
of
day
care
or
school
until
all
symptoms
are
gone.
Check
with
your
doctor
before
giving
your
child
any
medicine.
Drugs

usually
given
to
children
younger
than
5.To
help
prevent
rotavirus
--
the
most
common
cause
of
stomach
flu
for
children
--
there
are
two
vaccines
that
can
be
given
to
infants.
Talk
to
your
doctor
about
the
vaccines.What
Causes

are
many
ways

can
be
spread:Contact

someone
who

the
virusContaminated
food
or
waterUnwashed
hands
after
going
to
the
bathroom
or
changing
a
diaperThe
most
common
cause
of
gastroenteritis
is
a
virus. The
main
types
are
rotavirus
and
norovirus.Rotavirus
is
the
world's
most
common
cause
of
diarrhea
in
infants
and
young
children.
Norovirus
is
the
most
common
cause
of
serious
gastroenteritis
and
also
foodborne
disease
outbreaks
in
the
U.S.Although
not
as
common,
bacteria
such
as
E.
coli
and
salmonella
can
also
trigger
the
stomach
flu.
Salmonella
and
campylobacter

are
the
most
common
bacterial
causes
of
gastroenteritis
in
the
U.S.
and

usually
spread
by

and
common
sources
of

are
contaminated

Flu
and
Children
What
Causes
Gastroenteritis?
Gastroenteritis
Treatment
When
you
have
diarrhea
and
vomiting,
you
may
say
you
have
the
""stomach
flu.""
These
symptoms
often
are
due
to
a
condition
called
gastroenteritis.With
gastroenteritis,
your
stomach
and
intestines
are
irritated
and
inflamed.
The
cause
is
typically
a
viral
or
bacterial
infection.Symptoms
of
GastroenteritisWith
gastroenteritis,
the
main
symptoms
you
probably
have
are
watery
diarrhea
and
vomiting.
You
might
also
have
stomach
pain,
cramping,
fever,
nausea,
and
a
headache.Because
of
diarrhea
and
vomiting,
you
also
can
become
dehydrated.
Watch
for
signs
of
dehydration,
such
as
dry
skin
and
a
dry
mouth,
feeling
lightheaded,
and
being
really
thirsty.
Call
your
doctor
if
you
have
any
of
these
symptoms.Stomach
Flu
and
ChildrenChildren
can
get
dehydrated
quickly,
so
if
your
child
has
the
stomach
flu,
it's
important
that
you
look
for
signs
that
they
are very
thirsty
or
has
dry
skin
or
a
dry
mouth.
If
you
have
a
baby,
look
for
fewer,
drier
diapers.Keep
children
with
gastroenteritis
out
of
day
care
or
school
until
all
symptoms
are
gone.
Check
with
your
doctor
before
giving
your
child
any
medicine.
Drugs
used
to
control
diarrhea
and
vomiting
aren't
usually
given
to
children
younger
than
5.To
help
prevent
rotavirus
--
the
most
common
cause
of
stomach
flu
for
children
--
there
are
two
vaccines
that
can
be
given
to
infants.
Talk
to
your
doctor
about
the
vaccines.What
Causes
Gastroenteritis?There
are
many
ways
gastroenteritis
can
be
spread:Contact
with
someone
who
has
the
virusContaminated
food
or
waterUnwashed
hands
after
going
to
the
bathroom
or
changing
a
diaperThe
most
common
cause
of
gastroenteritis
is
a
virus. The
main
types
are
rotavirus
and
norovirus.Rotavirus
is
the
world's
most
common
cause
of
diarrhea
in
infants
and
young
children.
Norovirus
is
the
most
common
cause
of
serious
gastroenteritis
and
also
foodborne
disease
outbreaks
in
the
U.S.Although
not
as
common,
bacteria
such
as
E.
coli
and
salmonella
can
also
trigger
the
stomach
flu.
Salmonella
and
campylobacter
bacteria
are
the
most
common
bacterial
causes
of
gastroenteritis
in
the
U.S.
and
are
usually
spread
by
undercooked
poultry,
eggs,
or
poultry
juices.
Salmonella
can
also
be
spread
through
pet
reptiles
or
live
poultry.
Another
bacteria,
shigella,
is
often
passed
around
in
day
care
centers.
It
typically
is
spread
from
person
to
person,
and
common
sources
of
infection
are
contaminated
food
and
drinking
water.
Parasites
can
also
cause
gastroenteritis,
but
it's
not
common.
You
can
pick
up
organisms
such
as
giardia
and
cryptosporidium
in
contaminated
swimming
pools
or
by
drinking
contaminated
water.There
are
also
other
unusual
ways
to
get
gastroenteritis:Heavy
metals
(arsenic,
cadmium,
lead,
or
mercury)
in
drinking
waterEating
a
lot
of
acidic
foods,
like
citrus
fruit
and
tomatoesToxins
that
might
be
found
in
certain
seafoodMedications
such
as
antibiotics,
antacids,
laxatives,
and
chemotherapy
drugsGastroenteritis

Abstract
Background:
Pulmonary
tuberculosis
can
be
confirmed
by
positive
bacteriology
of
sputum,
bronchial
aspirate
or
by
biopsies
(microscopy
and/
or
culture)
or
by
histopathological
examination
highlighting
specific
tuberculous
granulomas.
When
microscopy
is
repeatedly
negative
during
noninvasive
methods,
lung
biopsy
by
thoracoscopy
is
needed
for
confirmation
and
differential
diagnosis.
Case
presentation:
A
40-year-old
female
patient
(nonsmoker,
diabetic,
with
previous
exposure
to
chemicals)
was
admitted
to
the
hospital
for
weight
loss,
dry
cough,
loss
of
appetite,
pallor,
and
fatigue.
Chest-X-ray
and
thoracic
CT
revealed
multiple
irregular
macronodules
with
various
shapes,
randomly
spread
across
the
lungs.
Bacteriology
for
acid
fast
bacilli
(AFB)
from
six
spontaneous
sputum
was
negative.
Bronchoscopy
showed
an
acute
bronchitis.
Bronchial
aspirate
was
negative
for
tumor
cells
and
AFB.
Several
biopsies
from
bronchial
wall
showed
unspecific
changes.
The
molecular
biology
tests
for
specific
nucleic
acids
detection
(Polymerase
Chain
Reaction)
or
positron-emission-tomography
(to
differentiate
benign
nodules
from
malign
ones)
were
not
accessible.
Multiple
biopsies
from
lung
parenchyma
and
pleura
were
obtained
using
thoracoscopy.
Histopathology
revealed
multiple
specific
tuberculous
granulomas.
The
complex
antituberculous
treatment
(9
months)
has
led
to
the
total
cure
of
the
disease
and
resorption
of
the
nodules.
The
patient’s
last
visit
(after
2
years)
showed
no
clinical/imagistic
or
bacteriologic
relapse
of
the
disease.
Conclusion:
Tuberculosis
may
present
in
the
form
of
multiple
macronodules
spread
randomly
across
the
lung
parenchyma.
Thoracoscopy
coupled
with
multiple
large
lung
biopsies
are
recommended
for
diagnosis
of
multinodular
lung
lesions,
especially
when
common
bacteriology/cytology
from
bronchoscopic
aspiration
failed
to
achieve
diagnosis.
Histological
exam
from
thoracoscopic
biopsies
allows
differential
diagnosis
between
entities
that
have
macronodular
features:
tuberculosis,
primitive
lung
cancer,
lymphomas,
metastatic
disease
or
invasive
fungal
disease.

Abstract
Background:
Pulmonary
tuberculosis
can
be
confirmed
by
positive
bacteriology
of
sputum,
bronchial
aspirate
or
by
biopsies
(microscopy
and/
or
culture)
or
by
histopathological
examination
highlighting
specific
tuberculous
granulomas.
When
microscopy
is
repeatedly
negative
during
noninvasive
methods,
lung
biopsy
by
thoracoscopy
is
needed
for
confirmation
and
differential
diagnosis.
Case
presentation:
A
40-year-old
female
patient
(nonsmoker,
diabetic,
with
previous
exposure
to
chemicals)
was
admitted
to
the
hospital
for
weight
loss,
dry
cough,
loss
of
appetite,
pallor,
and
fatigue.
Chest-X-ray
and
thoracic
CT
revealed
multiple
irregular
macronodules
with
various
shapes,
randomly
spread
across
the
lungs.
Bacteriology
for
acid
fast
bacilli
(AFB)
from
six
spontaneous
sputum
was
negative.
Bronchoscopy
showed
an
acute
bronchitis.
Bronchial
aspirate
was
negative
for
tumor
cells
and
AFB.
Several
biopsies
from
bronchial
wall
showed
unspecific
changes.
The
molecular
biology
tests
for
specific
nucleic
acids
detection
(Polymerase
Chain
Reaction)
or
positron-emission-tomography
(to
differentiate
benign
nodules
from
malign
ones)
were
not
accessible.
Multiple
biopsies
from
lung
parenchyma
and
pleura
were
obtained
using
thoracoscopy.
Histopathology
revealed
multiple
specific
tuberculous
granulomas.
The
complex
antituberculous
treatment
(9
months)
has
led
to
the
total
cure
of
the
disease
and
resorption
of
the
nodules.
The
patient’s
last
visit
(after
2
years)
showed
no
clinical/imagistic
or
bacteriologic
relapse
of
the
disease.
Conclusion:
Tuberculosis
may
present
in
the
form
of
multiple
macronodules
spread
randomly
across
the
lung
parenchyma.
Thoracoscopy
coupled
with
multiple
large
lung
biopsies
are
recommended
for
diagnosis
of
multinodular
lung
lesions,
especially
when
common
bacteriology/cytology
from
bronchoscopic
aspiration
failed
to
achieve
diagnosis.
Histological
exam
from
thoracoscopic
biopsies
allows
differential
diagnosis
between
entities
that
have
macronodular
features:
tuberculosis,
primitive
lung
cancer,
lymphomas,
metastatic
disease
or
invasive
fungal
disease.

(CNS)
involvement,
one
of
the
most
devastating
clinical
manifestations
of
tuberculosis
(TB)
is
noted
in
5
to
10%
of
extrapulmonary
TB
cases,
and
accounts
for
approximately
1%
of
all
TB
cases.
Definitive
diagnosis
of
tuberculous
meningitis
(TBM)
depends
upon
the
detection
of
the
tubercle
bacilli
in
the
CSF.
Every
patient
with
TBM
should
preferably
be
evaluated
by
imaging
with
contrast
enhanced
CT
either
before
or
within
the
first
48
hours
of
treatment.
An
extra-neural
focus
of
tuberculosis
should
be
sought
clinically
and
radiologically
in
all
patients
with
CNS
TB
as
it
may
indicate
safer
and
more
accessible
sites
for
diagnostic
samplings.
A
minimum
of
10
months
treatment
is
warranted,
prompted
by
the
uncertain
influences
of
disease
severity,
CNS
drug
penetration,
undetected
drug
resistance
and
patient
compliance.
All
patients
with
TB
meningitis
may
receive
adjunctive
corticosteroids
at
presentation
regardless
of
disease
severity
even
for
those
with
HIV
infection.
Drug
resistance
is
strongly
associated
with
previous
treatment.
The
key
principle
of
managing
drug-resistant
TB
is
never
to
add
a
single
drug
to
a
failing
regimen.
Early
ventriculo-peritoneal
shunting
should
be
considered
in
those
with
hydrocephalus
failing
medical
management.
The
single
most
important
determinant
of
outcome
is
the
stage
of
tuberculous
meningitis
at
which
treatment
has
been
started.Keywords:

to:IntroductionCentral
nervous
system
(CNS)
disease
caused
by
Mycobacterium
tuberculosis
is
highly
devastating,
and
accounts
for
approximately
1%
of
all
cases
of
tuberculosis
(TB).
It
carries
a
high
mortality
and
a
distressing
level
of
neurological
morbidity,
and
disproportionately
afflicts
children
and
human
immunodeficiency
virus
(HIV)
infected
individuals.
The
purpose
of
this
review
is
to
highlight
the
current
epidemiological,
clinical,
diagnostic,
and
therapeutic
aspects
of
CNS
tuberculosis.The
global
epidemiologic
burden
of
TBWorld
Health
Organisation
estimates
that
9.27
million
new
cases
of
TB
occurred
in
2007
(139/100,000
population),
compared
with
9.24
million
new
cases
(140/100,000
population)
in
2006
world
over1.
India,
China,
Indonesia,
Nigeria,
and
South
Africa
rank
first
to
fifth
in
the
total
number
of
incident
cases.
Among
the
15
countries
with
the
highest
estimated
TB
incidence
rates,
13
are
in
Africa,
a
phenomenon
linked
to
the
effect
of
high
rates
of
HIV
coinfection
on
the
natural
history
of
TB2.
Incidence
rates
are
falling
world
over
except
in
Eastern
Europe,
where
it
is
stable
and
increasing
only
in
African
countries
with
a
low
prevalence
of
HIV1,3.Among
the
9.27
million
incident
cases
of
TB
in
2007,
an
estimated
1.37
million
(14.8%)
are
HIV-positive1.
The
global
number
of
incident
HIV-positive
TB
cases
is
estimated
to
have
peaked
in
2005
at
1.39
million.
The
relative
risk
of
developing
TB
in
HIV-positive
people
compared
to
HIV-negative
people
(the
incidence
rate
ratio)
is
20.6
in
countries
with
a
HIV
prevalence
greater
than
1%
in
the
general
population,
about
26.7
where
HIV
prevalence
range
from
0.1%
and
1%,
and
36.7
in
countries
with
a
prevalence
less
than
0.1%.4PrevalenceAbout
13.7
million
prevalent
cases
were
estimated
in
2007
(206/100,000
population),
a
slight
decrease
from
13.9
million
in
2006.
The
global
prevalence
of
TB
is
estimated
to
have
been
declining
since
1990.
This
decline
is
in
marked
contrast
to
the
increase
in
TB
incidence
in
the
1990s,
which
can
be
explained
by
a
decrease
in
the
average
duration
of
disease
as
the
fraction
of
cases
treated
in
the
DOTS
programs
increased
and
a
comparatively
short
duration
of
disease
among
HIV-positive
cases
specifically
with
limited
access
to
antiretroviral
therapy
(ART).
The
duration
of
TB
among
HIV-positive
patients
is
relatively
short
for
in
people
with
advanced
HIV
infection,
the
progression
to
severe
tuberculosis
is
rapid,
with
a
marked
reduction
in
life
expectancy5.
Infection
of
the
CNS
is
one
of
the
most
devastating
clinical
manifestations
of
tuberculosis.
In
an
American
epidemiological
study
of
extrapulmonary
tuberculosis,
up
to
10%
of
cases
showed
CNS
involvement6,
while
CDC
data
indicated
that
6.3%
of
extrapulmonary
cases
(1.3%
of
total
tuberculosis
cases)
had
CNS
TB.7
In
a
Taiwan
study,
1.5%
of
TB
deaths
between
1997
and
2001
were
attributable
to
CNS
disease,
a
percentage
that
had
increased
from
previous
years8.Risk
factorsRisk
factors
for
CNS
tuberculosis
include
age
(children>
adults)
HIV-coinfection9,
malnutrition,
recent
measles
in
children10,
alcoholism,
malignancies,
the
use
of
immunosuppressive
agents
in
adults
and
disease
prevalence
in
the
community11,12.Clinical
featuresIn
most
patients
with
tuberculous
meningitis
there
is
a
history
of
vague
ill
health
lasting
2–8
weeks
prior
to
the
development
of
meningeal
irritation.
These
nonspecific
symptoms
include
malaise,
anorexia,
fatigue,
fever,
myalgias,
and

(TBM)
can
often
present
with
the
classic
meningitis
symptoms
of
fever,
headache
and
stiff
neck
along
with
focal
neurological
deficits,
behavioral
changes,
and
alterations
in
consciousness14.
A
history
of
tuberculosis
is
elicited
in
only
approximately
10%
of
patients14.
The
presence
of
active
pulmonary
tuberculosis
on
chest
X-
ray
ranges
from
30
to
50%.
Patients
coinfected
with
HIV
do
not
seem
to
have
an
altered
presentation
of
TBM15.
About
10%
of
cases
with
TBM
have
some
form
of
spinal
tuberculosis.

to
be
a

of

Infiltrative,
proliferative
and
necrotising

pathologies
have
been
described,
leading
to
luminal
thrombosis.
There
is
some
evidence
that
vasospasm
may
mediate
strokes
early
in
the
course
of
the
disease
and
proliferative
intimal
disease
later
strokes16.Children
with
TBM
often
present
with
fever,
stiff
neck,
seizures,
and
abdominal
symptoms
such
as
nausea
and
vomiting.
Headache
occurs
less
often
than
in
adults.
Depending
on
the
stage
of
presentation,
neurological
symptoms
range
from
lethargy
and
agitation
to
coma.
TBM
in
children
develops
most
often
within
3
months
of
primary
tuberculosis
infection17.
A
family
history
of
tuberculosis
can
be
identified
in
approximately
50
to
60%
of
children,
and
a
positive

in

30
to
50%.

In

there
appears
to
be

with
disseminated

Optochiasmatic

Encephalopathy
(TBE)TBE
is
a
rare
outcome
usually
more
common
in
younger
population
and
is
characterized
by
diffuse
brain
edema
and
demyelination,
which
usually
is
extensive27.
Microscopically
it
is
characterized
by
microvascular
necrosis
with
perivascular
macrophage
reaction
and
demyelination
along
with
focal
glial
nodules
in
the
white
matter
and
occasional
hemorrhagic
lesions.
Impaired
consciousness,
seizures,
disseminated
intravascular
coagulation,
signs
and
symptoms
of
meningitis
with
or
without
spinal
fluid
changes
characterize
this
syndrome.
This
syndrome
may
be
one
of
the
leading
causes
of
neurologic
devastation
and
death
in
CNS
TB
patients
with
high
alcohol
intake.Spinal
tuberculosisInvolvement
of
the
spine
occurs
in
less
than
1%
of
TB
patients
and
it
can
be
secondary
to
Pott's
spine
or
as
non-osseous
spinal
cord
tuberculosis
or
spinal
tuberculous
meningitis.
It
is
a
leading
cause
of
paraplegia
in
developing
nations.
In
Pott's
spine
infection
in
the
vertebral
bodies
usually
starts
in
cancellous
bone
adjacent
to
an
intervertebral
disc
or
anteriorly
under
the
periosteum
of
the
vertebral
body;
the
neural
arch
is
rarely
affected.
Vertebral
destruction
leads
to
collapse
of
the
body
of
the
vertebra
along
with
anterior
wedging.
Spinal
cord
compression
in
Pott's
spine
is
mainly
caused
by
pressure
from
a
paraspinal
abscess.
Neurological
deficits
may
also
result
from
dural
invasion
by
granulation
tissue
and
compression
from
the
debris
of
sequestrated
bone,
a
destroyed
intervertebral
disc,
or
a
dislocated
vertebra.
Rarely,
vascular
insufficiency
in
the
territory
of
the
anterior
spinal
artery
has
also
been
suggested.
Neurological
involvement
can
occur
at
any
stage
of
Pott's
spine
and
even
years
later,
when
there
has
been
apparent
healing,
because
of
stretching
of
the
cord
in
the
deformed
spinal
canal.
The
thoracic
spine
is
involved
in
about
65%
of
cases,
and
the
lumbar,
cervical
and
thoracolumbar
spine
in
about
20%,
10%
and
5%,
respectively.
The
atlanto-axial
region
may
also
be
involved
in
less
than
1%
of
cases.
Males
are
affected
more
often
than
females
in
most
series,
and
the
disease
generally
affects
young
persons.Typically,
there
is
a
history
of
local
pain,
tenderness
over
the
affected
spine
or
even
overlying
bony
deformity
in
the
form
of
gibbus.
Paravertebral
abscess
may
be
palpated
on
the
back
of
a
number
of
patients.
These
patients
usually
have
acute
or
subacute,
progressive,
spastic
type
of
sensorimotor
paraparesis.
The
incidence
of
paraparesis
in
patients
with
Pott's
spine
varies
from
27%
to
47%.28Non-osseous
spinal
cord
tuberculosis
can
occur
in
the
form
of
tuberculomas.
Dastur
29
reviewed
74
cases
of
tuberculous
paraplegia
without
evidence
of
Pott's
disease
and
observed
that
extradural
tuberculomas
occurred
in
64%
while
arachnoid
lesions
without
dural
involvement,
and
subdural/extramedullary
lesions
occured
in
8%
of
patients
in
each
group.
Intramedullary
tuberculomas
are
extremely
rarely
reported
and
are
frequently
located
in
the
thoracic
region.
More
than
one
site
in
the
spinal
cord
may
also
be
affected.
The
clinical
features
are
indistinguishable
from
those
of
any
extramedullary
or
intramedullary
tumour,
although
acute
worsening
may
occur.
Non-osseous
spinal
cord
tuberculomas
may
increase
in
size
while
the
patient
is
on
antituberculous
therapy.A
predominantly
spinal
form
of
tuberculous
meningitis
may
result
from
rupture
of
Rich's
focus
into
the
spinal
arachnoid
space
rather
than
the
basal
meninges.
The
acute
form
presents
with
fever,
headache,
and
radiating
root
pains,
accompanied
by
myelopathy.
The
chronic
form,
usually
localised
to
a
few
segments,
presents
with
progressive
spinal
cord
compression
and
may
suggest
a
spinal
cord
tumour.
The
characteristic
MRI
features
include
CSF
loculation
and
obliteration
of
the
spinal
subarachnoid
space
with
loss
of
outline
of
spinal
cord
in
the
cervicothoracic
region
and
matting
of
nerve
roots
in
the
lumbar
region.
Spinal

Reconstitution
Inflammatory
Syndrome
and
TBTwo
forms
of
Immune
Reconstitution
Inflammatory
Syndrome
(IRIS)
are
recognized
in
the
case
of
TB.
(a)
Paradoxical
TB-IRIS
occurs
in
patients
diagnosed
with
TB
and
established
on
TB
treatment
before
ART,
who
then
manifest
with
recurrent
or
new
TB
symptoms
and
clinical
manifestations
after
ART
initiation.(b)
Unmasking
TB-IRIS
occurs
in
patients
who
are
not
on
TB
treatment
when
they
start
ART,
and
who
then
have
an
unusually
inflammatory
presentation
of
TB
in
the
first
3
months
of
ART
30.Paradoxical
TB-IRIS
reactions
during
TB
treatment
(new
or
recurrent
TB
symptoms,
or
signs
occurring
after
initial
response
to
treatment)
occur
in
patients
not
infected
with
HIV-1
and
patients
infected
with
HIV-1
and
not
on
ART.
Manifestations
include
recurrent
fevers,
worsening
pulmonary
infiltrates,
enlarging
pleural
effusions,
the
development
of
TBM,
new
or
enlarging
tuberculomas,
or
tuberculous
lesions
developing
at
other
anatomic
sites.
The
pathogenesis
has
variably
been
attributed
to
a
combination
of
the
following
factors:
release
of
new
antigen
targets
during
mycobacterial
killing,
hypersensitivity
to
such
antigens,
and
exaggerated
immune
restoration
(following
TB-induced
immunosuppression)
occurring
on
TB
treatment.
The
development
of
paradoxical
reactions
in
patients
not
infected
with
HIV-1
is
associated
with
greater
increases
in
total
lymphocyte
count
on
TB
treatment.
Paradoxical
reactions
are
also
far
more
frequent
in
the
period
after
ART
initiation
than
in
patients
not
infected
with
HIV-1
and
patients
infected
with
HIV-1
and
not
on
ART
(36%
vs
2%
vs
7%,
respectively,
in
one
study31.
The
risk
factors
for
paradoxical
IRIS
are
disseminated
TB,
low
CD4
count
before
ART,
and
shorter
interval
from
TB
treatment
to
ART.It
is
important
to
investigate
for
other
opportunistic
infections
and
malignancies,
TB
treatment
failure
(due
to
nonadherence,
TB
drug
resistance,
or
malabsorption
of
TB
drugs),
or
drug
reaction.
In
addition,
TB-IRIS
may
develop
in
patients
with
undiagnosed
rifampicin
resistance,
clinically
indistinguishable
from
TB-IRIS
which
occurs
in
patients
with
drug-susceptible
disease.
If
possible,
drug
susceptibility
testing,
preferably
a
rapid
diagnostic
assay,
should
be
performed
in
all
patients
presenting
with
paradoxical
TB-IRIS.
Corticosteroids
have
been
used
for
management
of
TB-IRIS
when
alternative
diagnoses
have
been
excluded.
Unmasking
TB-IRIS
is
less
well
characterized
than
paradoxical
TB-IRIS,
with
fewer
cases
reported.
A
subset
of
these
cases
presenting
with
heightened
intensity
of
clinical
manifestations,
particularly
when
there
is
evidence
of
a
marked
inflammatory
component,
during
the
first
3
months
of
ART
are
termed
as
“unmasking
TB-IRIS.”Go

The
importance
of
obtaining

is
that

Once
anti-tuberculosis

is
commenced,
the
sensitivity

falls
rapidly.
The

A

much
higher
diagnostic

for
the

be
made

release
assays
(IGRAs).
IGRAs
are
in
vitro
tests
that
are
based
on
interferon-γ(IFN-
γ)
release
after
T-cell
stimulation
by
antigens
(such
as
early
secreted
antigenic
target
6
[ESAT6]
and
culture
filtrate
protein
10
[CFP10])
that
are
more
specific
to
MTB
than
the
purified
protein
derivative
(PPD).
Two
IGRAs
are
currently
available
as
commercial
kits.
Systematic
reviews
have
reported
strong
evidence
that
IGRAs
have
high
specificity
that
is
unaffected
by
bacille
Calmette-
Guérin
(BCG)
vaccination41,
42.
TST,
in
contrast,
has
high
specificity
in
populations
who
have
not
been
vaccinated
with
BCG
but
specificity
is
modest
and
inconsistent
in
populations
vaccinated
with
BCG.
The
high
specificity
of
IGRAs
is
proving
to
be
useful
in
individuals
vaccinated
with
BCG43.
IGRAs
may
be
excellent
options
in
these
populations
and
it
seems
to
be
at
least
as
sensitive
as
TST42.
Both
these
immune-based
tests
merely
indicate
a
cellular
immune
response
to
recent
or
remote
sensitization
with
MTB.
IFN-γ
can
be
easily
induced
in
peripheral
blood
monocytes
or
whole
blood
through
antigenic
stimulation
in
sufficient
quantities
that
it
can
be
detected
using
simple
technologies,
such
as
ELISA.
IGRA
tests
rely
on
detecting
elevated
IFN-γ
production
after
stimulation
with
antigens
(ESAT-6,
CFP10).
Because
these
antigens
are
largely
restricted
to
members
of
the
MTB
complex,
the
tests
are
not
confounded
by
BCG
or
environmental
mycobacteria.
Because
IGRAs
cannot
distinguish
between
latent
and
active
TB,
a
positive
IGRA
result
may
not
necessarily
indicate
active
TB.
A
negative
IGRA
result
would
not
conclusively
rule
out
active
disease
in
an
individual
suspected
to
have
TB
(similar
to
the
results
of
a
TST).
About
50%
of
patients
with
culture-confirmed
TBM
had
no
detectable
MTB
-specific
interferon-gamma
producing
lymphocytes
in
peripheral
blood
at
presentation40.The
use
of
IGRAs
is
steadily
increasing
in
countries
with
low
or
intermediate
incidence.
Despite
the
large
number
of
publications
on
IGRAs,
evidence
is
still
limited
on
the
prognostic
value
of
these
tests,
and
their
added
value
in
TB
diagnosis44.
There
is
growing
evidence
that
the
performance
of
IGRAs
varies
between
countries
with
high
and
low
incidence
of
TB45.
Their
role,
if
any,
seems
to
be
limited
in
low
income
countries
with
a
high
TB
burden.ADAADA
is
associated
largely
with
lymphocytic
proliferation
and
differentiation
and
is
considered
to
be
a
marker
of
cell-mediated
immunity46.
The
measured
sensitivities
and
specificities
of
ADA
in
the
CSF
range
from
44
to
100%
and
71
to
100%,
respectively47.
In
one
study,
ADA
was
not
valuable
in
distinguishing
TBM
in
patients
with
HIV
infection.48
Standardized
cutoffs
of
ADA
values
for
the
diagnosis
of
TBM
have
not
been
established,
and
the
values
used
in
various
studies
ranged
from
>5.0
to
>15
IU/liter.
CSF
ADA
measurements
have
been
found
to
be
useful
in
predicting
poor
neurological
outcomes
among
pediatric
TBM
cases49.
Raised
ADA
activity
in
the
CSF
of
patients
with
CNS
TB
lacks
specificity.
High
CSF
ADA
activity
has
been
reported
from
patients
with
lymphomas,
malaria,
brucellosis,
pyogenic
meningitis,
cryptococcal
meningitis,
and
cerebral
lymphomas50,
51.
CSF
ADA

not
recommended
as
a

acidTuberculostearic
acid
is
a
fatty
acid
component
of
the
M.
tuberculosis
cell
wall52.
Although
its
estimation
has
good
sensitivity
and
specificity
in
limited
studies,
the
requirement
for
expensive

has
limited
its
clinical
use.Radiological
EvaluationEvery
patient
with
TBM
should
preferably
be
evaluated
with
contrast
enhanced
CT
imaging
before
the
start
or
within
the
first
48
hours
of
treatment35.
Early
brain
CT
can
help
diagnose
TBM,
and
will
provide
important
baseline
information
regarding
surgical
interventions
for
hydrocephalus.
Choroid
plexus
enhancement
with
ventricular
enlargement
on
imaging
is
highly
suggestive
of
TBM.
In
TBM,
MRI
shows
diffuse,
thick,
meningeal
enhancement.
Cerebral
infarcts
can
be
seen
in
nearly
30%
of
cases53.
A
study
from
South
Africa
reported
that
the
combination
of
hydrocephalus,
basal
enhancement
and
infarction
was
100%
specific
and
41%
sensitive
for
the
diagnosis
of
childhood
TBM,
although
the
authors
suggested
pre-contrast
hyperdensity
in
the
basal
cisterns
as
the
best
predictor
of
TBM54.Contrast
enhanced
MRI
is
generally
considered
as
the
modality
of
choice.
It
is
useful
for
assessment
of
the
location
of
lesions
and
their
margins,
as
well
as
ventriculitis,
meningitis
and
spinal
involvement
(sensitivity

of
CNS
TBThe
first
combination
therapy
for
TB
consisted
of
para-aminosalicylic
acid
(PAS)
and
isoniazid
(H)
in
addition
to
streptomycin,
given
for
24
months,
and
it
became
the
basis
for
treatment
of
TB
in
the
developed
world
for
about
a
decade.
In
the
mid
1960s,
PAS
was
replaced
by
ethambutol
(E),
a
better-tolerated
drug,
and
the
treatment
duration
was
reduced
from
24
to
18
months.
In
the
late
1960s
rifampicin-containing
regimen
including
isoniazid,
ethambutol,
and
streptomycin
offered
a
predictable
cure
in
more
than
95%
of
patients
with
9-
to
12-month
duration
of
therapy.
In
the
early
1980s
addition
of
pyrazinamide
(Z)
in
the
intensive
phase
of
treatment,
decreased
the
duration
of
a
fully
orally
administered
treatment
to
6
to
8
months.
Studies
conducted
in
East
Africa
showed
that
the
relapse
rate
after
a
6-month
regimen
was
reduced
from
22%
to
8%
by
the
addition
of
pyrazinamide,
and
to
3%
by
the
addition
of
rifampicin58.Since
the
1980s
the
6-
to
8-month
regimen,
using
a
4-drug
combination
(HRZE)
in
the
initial
phase
followed
by
a
2-drug
combination
(HR
or
HE)
in
the
continuation
phase,
has
been
widely
accepted59.
In
2004
the
results
of
a
multicenter
randomized
clinical
trial,
showed
higher
efficacy
for
the
6-month
regimen
(2
months
of
HRZE
plus
4
months
of
HR:
2HRZE/4HR)
compared
with
the
8-month
therapy
(2HRZE/6HE)60.
The
recommended
first-line

agents
for

to
at

12
months
in
those

Isoniazid
penetrates
the
CSF
freely61
and
has
potent
early
bactericidal
activity.
At
standard
doses
isoniazid
achieves
CSF
levels
10–15
times
the
minimum
inhibitory
concentration
of
M.
tuberculosis62.
The
main
disadvantage
of
INH
is
that
resistance
develops
quite
quickly
when
used
as
monotherapy
though
this
does
not
seem
to
happen
when
it
is
used
to
eradicate
the
organism
in
a
patient
who
has
become
infected
but
has
not
yet
developed
overt
signs
or
symptoms
of
infection
(chemoprophylaxis).
Pyridoxine
is
extremely
effective
in
stopping
the
seizures,
reversing
the
coma,
and
correcting
the
metabolic
acidosis
triggered
by
any
acute
overdose
of
isoniazid.
Treatment
is
best
given
as
a
relatively
rapid
intravenous
(IV)
infusion,
the
standard
dose
being
one
mg
of
pyridoxine
for
every
mg
of
isoniazid
the
patient
is
thought
to
have
taken63.
Crushed
tablets
can
be
given
down
a
nasogastric
tube
if
no
IV
preparation
is
readily
available.
Prompt
treatment
is
called
for
because
INH
dose
in
excess
of
90
mg/kg
is
extremely
likely
to
trigger
recurrent
seizure
activity,
which
can
be
fatal64.
Rifampicin
penetrates
the
CSF
less
well
(maximum
concentrations
around
30%
of
plasma),
but
the
high
mortality
from
rifampicin
resistant
TBM
has
confirmed
its
key
role
in
the
treatment
of
CNS
disease65.
The
incidence
of
ethambutol
induced
optic
neuritis
is
less
than
3%
at
the
standard
dose
of
15–20
mg/kg
though
it
is
a
concern,
especially
when
treating
comatose
patients66.
Fluoroquinolones
are
an
effective
fourth
agent
(if
ethambutol
is
contraindicated),
but
should
be
avoided
in
women
who
are
pregnant
or
breastfeeding
and
prolonged
fluoroquinolone
therapy
is
not
advised
for
children67.
Interruptions
in

are
an
independent

factor
for
death
from
TBM68.Rationale
use
of
steroids
in
CNS
TBAll
patients
with
TBM
may
receive
adjunctive
corticosteroids
regardless
of
disease
severity
at
presentation.
Adults
(>14
years)
should
start
treatment
with
dexamethasone
0.4
mg/kg/24
hours
with
a
tapering
course
over
6
to
8
weeks.
Children
(d″14
years)
should
be
given
prednisolone
4mg/kg/24
hrs
(or
equivalent
dose
dexamethasone:
0.6
mg/kg/24
hrs)
for
4
weeks,
followed
by
a
tapering
course
over
4
weeks69.
The
role
of
routine
adjunctive
corticosteroids
for
all
patients
with
tuberculomas
without
meningitis,
or
with
spinal
cord
tuberculosis
is
arguable
albeit
corticosteroids
may
be
helpful
in
those
patients
whose
symptoms
are
not
controlled,
or
are
worsening,
on
anti-tuberculosis
therapy.
Doses
similar
to
those
used
for
TBM
should
be
given.
Thalidomide
may
be
helpful
in
patients
with
tuberculomas
that
are
not
responding
to
antituberculosis
drugs
and
high

corticosteroids70.Management

tuberculosis
in
HIV
infected
patients
should
be
managed
with
the
same
anti-tuberculosis
drug
regimen
as
that
recommended
for
HIV
uninfected
individuals;
whenever
possible
the
regimen
should
include
rifampicin.
Adjunctive
corticosteroids
are
recommended
for
those
with

it
is
better
to
defer
HIV
treatment
as
long
as
possible,
ideally
until
end
of

treatment35.
Start
anti-retroviral
treatment
(ART)
if
the
CD4

falls
below
200

during

treatment.
If
CD4
is
100–200
cells/ìL
start
ART
after
approximately
2
months
of
anti-tuberculosis
treatment
so
that
risk
of

is
minimised.
If
CD4
is
<
100
cells/ìL
start
ART
within
the
first
2
weeks
of
anti-tuberculosis
treatment.
Rifampicin
will
induce
the
metabolism
of
protease
inhibitors,
delavirdine
and
nevirapine
reducing
the
level
of
these
drugs.
When
possible,
treat
with
rifampicin
and
a
non-nucleoside
reverse
transcriptase
inhibitor
(NNRTI),
preferably
efavirenz
but
the
dose
of
efavirenz
should
be
increased
to
800mg.
Rifabutin
should
be
used
if
treatment
with
a
protease
inhibitor
(PI)
is
required,
but
at
a
reduced
dose
(usually
150mg
3
times
per
week).
If
efavirenz
and
rifabutin
are
co-administered,
a

guidelines
for

19

of
the

of
neurosurgeryHydrocephalus,
tuberculous
brain
abscess
(TBA),
and
vertebral
tuberculosis
with
cord
compression
are
all
indications
for
urgent
neurosurgical
referral
though
early
hydrocephalus
and
tuberculous
brain
abscess
can
be
successfully
treated
by
drugs
alone
.
So
early
recognition
and
timely
treatment
is
critical
in
avoiding
the
surgery.
TBA
occurs
in
only
4%
to
8%
of
patients
with
CNS
TB
who
do
not
have
HIV
infection
but
in
20%
of
patients
who
do
have
HIV
infection.
The
aim
of
surgical
management
of
TBA
is
to
reduce
the
size
of
the
space-occupying
lesion
and
thereby
diminish
intracranial
pressure
and
to
eradicate
the
pathogen.
Early
surgical
drainage
and
chemotherapy
are
considered
the
most
appropriate
treatment
for
TBA
and
can
be
therapeutic
as
well
as
diagnostic.
It
should
be
carefully
planned
and
individualized
according
to
the
patient's
clinical
condition,
anatomic
localization,
and
the
number
of
lesions.
Early
anti
tuberculous
therapy
(ATT)
must
be
considered
in
all
cases
of
suspected
TBA
even
before
surgery,
in
order
to
reduce
the
risk
of
postoperative
meningitis.
An
open
surgical
excision
is
an
appropriate
treatment
option
for
large,
multiloculated
cerebellar
lesions
that
cause
brain
herniation
and
also
in
those
that
do
not
respond
to
aspiration
while
stereotactic-guided
aspiration
is
preferred
in
eloquent
or
deep-seated
areas
such
as
the
hypothalamus,
thalamus,
or
deep
temporal
regions
in
order
to
prevent
severe
neurological
sequelae.
The
main
disadvantage
of
the
latter
option
is
the
need
for
repeated
procedures
in
as
many
as
70%
of
patients,
and
the
high
risk
of
rupture
into
ventricles
or
the
subarachnoid
space,
which
could
lead
to
ventricular
ependymitis
or
meningitis
and
worsening
of
neurological
deficits.
An
early
surgical
procedure
can
improve
the
efficacy
of
ATT,
promote
a
better
clinical
response
after
reduction
of
bacillary
load
and
reduce
mortality72.
Hydrocephalus,
either
communicating(more
common)
or
obstructive,
is
one
of
the
commonest
complications
of
TBM
occurring
in
up
to
85%
of
children
with
the
disease
in
whom
it
is
more
severe
than
in
adults.
Patients
with
TBM
and
hydrocephalus
who
have
a
Glascow
coma
scale
(GCS)
of
15
(with
or
without
focal
neurological
deficit)
could
be
tried
for
a
few
days
or
a
week
on
diuretics
and
steroids
with
close
monitoring
to
detect
any
worsening
or
lack
of
improvement
and
a
shunt
should
promptly
be
offered
in
case
of
failure
of
medical
management.
Ventriculoperitoneal
shunt
is
the
procedure
of
choice
if
the
duration
of
illness
is
<4
weeks
while
endoscopic
third
ventriculostomy
or
ventriculoperitoneal
shunt
can
be
offered
if
duration
>4weeks.
Patients
with
GCS
>8
and
<14
are
better
off
with
an
early
shunt
procedure
and
so
are
those
with
GCS
>3
and
<8
who
improve
within
48
hours
after
an
external
ventricular
drainage
(EDV)
while
those
with
GCS
>3
and
<8
who
fail
the
EDV
trial
are
unlikely
to
benefit
with
shunt
and
are
managed
conservatively73.
Urgent
surgical
decompression
should
be
considered
in
all
those
with
extradural
lesions
causing
paraparesis74.Prognosis
and
sequelaeThe
single
most
important
determinant
of
outcome,
for
both
survival
and
sequelae,
is
the
stage
of
tuberculous
meningitis
at
which
treatment
has
been
started
others
being
extremes
of
age,
malnutrition,
hydrocephalus,
focal
neurological
deficit
,presence
of
miliary
disease
,
underlying
debilitating
disease
and
alcoholism.
If
treatment
is
started
in
stage
I,
mortality
and
morbidity
is
very
low,
while
in
stage
III
almost
50%
of
patients
die,
and
those
who
recover
may
have
some
form
of
neurological
deficit75.
Survivors
manifest
a
variety
of
neurological
sequelae.
Intracranial
calcification
develops
in
20%
to
48%
of
patients
with
tuberculous
meningitis,
usually
becoming
detectable
2
to
3
years
after
the
onset
of
the
disease76.Go
to:ConclusionEarly
recognition
and
timely
treatment
of
CNS
TB
is
critical
if
the
considerable
mortality
and
morbidity
associated
with
the
condition
is
to
be
prevented.
A
minimum
of
10
month-treatment
is
warranted,
and
the
single
most
important
determinant
of
outcome
is
the
stage
of
tuberculous
meningitis
at
which
treatment
has
been
started.Go

Tuberculous
meningitis
is
an
infection
of
the
tissues
covering
the
brain
and
spinal
cord
(meninges).Causes
Expand
Section
Tuberculous
meningitis
is
caused
by
Mycobacterium
tuberculosis.
This
is
the
bacterium
that
causes
tuberculosis
(TB).
The
bacteria
spread
to
the
brain
and
spine
from
another
place
in
the
body,
usually
the
lung.Tuberculous
meningitis
is
very
rare
in
the
United
States.
Most
cases
are
people
who
traveled
to
the
United
States
from
other
countries
where
TB
is
common.People
who
have
the
following
have
a
higher
chance
of
developing
tuberculous
meningitis:HIV/AIDSDrink

This
is
usually
found
in
infants
(less
than
3
months
old)Exams
and
Tests
Expand
Section
The
health
care
provider
will
examine
you.
This
will
usually
show
that
you
have
the
following:Fast
heart
rateFeverMental
status
changesStiff
neck
A
lumbar
puncture
(spinal
tap)
is
an
important
test
in
diagnosing
meningitis.
It
is
done
to
collect
a
sample
of
spinal
fluid
for
examination.
More
than
one
sample
may
be
needed
to
make
the
diagnosis.Other
tests
that
may
be
done
include:Biopsy
of
the
brain
or
meninges

Treatment
Expand
Section
You
will
be
given
several
medicines
to
fight
the
TB
bacteria.
Sometimes,
treatment
is
started
even
if
your
provider
thinks
you
have
the
disease,
but
testing
has
not
confirmed
it
yet.Treatment
usually
lasts
for
at
least
12
months.
Medicines
called
corticosteroids
may
also
be
used.Outlook
(Prognosis)
Expand
Section
Tuberculous
meningitis
is
life
threatening
if
untreated.
Long-term
follow-up
is
needed
to
detect
repeated
infections
(recurrences).Possible
Complications
Expand
Section
Untreated,
the
disease
can
cause
any
of
the
following:Brain
damageBuild-up
of
fluid
between
the
skull
and
brain
(subdural
effusion)Hearing
lossHydrocephalus (buildup
of

leads
to
brain
swelling)SeizuresDeathWhen
to
Contact
a
Medical
Professional
Expand
Section
Call
the
local
emergency
number
(such
as
911)
or
go
to
an
emergency
room
if
you
suspect
meningitis
in
a
young
child
who
has
the
following
symptoms:Feeding
problemsHigh-pitched
cryIrritabilityPersistent
unexplained
fever
Call
the
local
emergency
number
if
you
develop
any
of
the
serious
symptoms
listed
above.
Meningitis
can
quickly
become
a
life-threatening
illness.Prevention
Expand
Section
Treating
people
who
have
signs
of
a
non-active
(dormant)
TB
infection
can
prevent
its
spread.
A
PPD
test
and
other
TB
tests
can
be
done
to
tell
if
you
have
this
type
of
infection.Some
countries
with
a
high
incidence
of
TB
give
people
a
vaccine
called
BCG
to
prevent
TB.
But,
the
effectiveness
of
this
vaccine
is
limited,
and
it
is
not
usually
used
in
the
United
States.
The
BCG
vaccine
may
help
prevent
severe
forms
of
TB,
such
as
meningitis,
in
very
young
children
who
live
in
areas
where
the
disease
is
common.Alternative

General
DiscussionTuberculous
Meningitis
(TBM)
is
a
form
of
meningitis
characterized
by
inflammation
of
the
membranes
(meninges)
around
the
brain
or
spinal
cord
and
caused
by
a
specific
bacterium
known
as
Mycobacterium
tuberculosis.
In
TBM,
the
disorder
develops
gradually.
Treatment
with
antibiotics
and
other
drugs
is
usually
effective
against
the
infection.
Signs
&
SymptomsTuberculous
Meningitis
involves
the
central
nervous
system.
Headaches
and
behavioral
changes
may
be
noticed
initially.
Fever,
headache,
a
stiff
neck,
and
vomiting
may
also
occur.
Symptoms
among
older
children
and
adults
may
progress
from
irritability
to
confusion,
drowsiness,
and
stupor,
possibly
leading
to
coma.Untreated,
this
disorder
can
lead
to
seizures,
hydrocephalus
(accumulation
of
fluid
in
the
brain
cavity),
deafness,
mental
retardation,
paralysis
of
one
side
of
the
body
(hemiparesis)
and
other
neurological
abnormalities.
(For
more
information
on
this
disorder,
choose
“hydrocephalus”
as
your
search
term
in
the
Rare
Disease
Database).Diagnosis
is
made
by
examination
of
the
cerebrospinal
fluid.
CausesTuberculous
Meningitis
is
a
rare
complication
that
occurs
in
some
patients
who
have
or
have
had
tuberculosis
(TB),
especially
miliary
tuberculosis.
It
can
also
occur
in
people
who
have
been
exposed
to
the
bacteria
that
causes
TB.
This
form
of
meningitis
is
caused
by
a
specific
bacteria
known
as
Mycobacterium
Tuberculosis.
(For
more
information
on
tuberculosis,
choose

Affected
PopulationsTBM
is
usually
found
in
children
aged
one
to
five
years
although
it
may
occur
at
any
age.
Related
DisordersSymptoms
of
the
following
disorders
may
resemble
those
of
Tuberculous
Meningitis.
Comparisons
may
be
useful
for
a
differential
diagnosis:In
general,
Meningitis
is
characterized
by
inflammation
of
the
membranes
(meninges)
around
the
brain
or
spinal
cord.
This
inflammation
may
be
caused
by
different
types
of
bacteria,
viruses,
fungi,
malignant
tumors,
or
reactions
to
certain
injections
into
the
spinal
canal.
(For
more
information
on
other
forms
of
meningitis,
choose
“meningitis”
as
your
search
term
in
the
Rare
Disease
Database.)Encephalitis
is
an
infection
of
the
brain
which
is
brought
on
by
one
of
several
different
types
of
viruses.
Encephalitis
may
also
be
caused
by
hypersensitivity
initiated
by
some
other
non-viral,
foreign
protein.
Many
of
the
symptoms
are
similar
to
those
of
TBM,
such
as
a
stiff
neck,
altered
reflexes,
confusion,
speech
disorders,
convulsions,
paralysis
and
coma.

Standard
TherapiesMeningitis
is
usually
treated
with
antibiotic
drugs
used
against
the
bacteria
causing
the
infection.
These
may
include
isoniazid,
rifampin,
streptomycin,
and
ethambutol.
Treatment
should
last
for
at
least
9
months
to
one
year.
Corticosteroid
drugs
such
as
prednisone
may
also
be
of
benefit.

involvement,
one
of
the
most
devastating
clinical
manifestations
of
tuberculosis
(TB)
is
noted
in
5
to
10%
of
extrapulmonary
TB
cases,
and
accounts
for
approximately
1%
of
all
TB
cases.
Definitive
diagnosis
of
tuberculous
meningitis
(TBM)
depends
upon
the
detection
of
the
tubercle
bacilli
in
the
CSF.
Every
patient
with
TBM
should
preferably
be
evaluated
by
imaging
with
contrast
enhanced
CT
either
before
or
within
the
first
48
hours
of
treatment.
An
extra-neural
focus
of
tuberculosis
should
be
sought
clinically
and
radiologically
in
all
patients
with
CNS
TB
as
it
may
indicate
safer
and
more
accessible
sites
for
diagnostic
samplings.
A
minimum
of
10
months
treatment
is
warranted,
prompted
by
the
uncertain
influences
of
disease
severity,
CNS
drug
penetration,
undetected
drug
resistance
and
patient
compliance.
All
patients
with
TB
meningitis
may
receive
adjunctive
corticosteroids
at
presentation
regardless
of
disease
severity
even
for
those
with
HIV
infection.
Drug
resistance
is
strongly
associated
with
previous
treatment.
The
key
principle
of
managing
drug-resistant
TB
is
never
to
add
a
single
drug
to
a
failing
regimen.
Early
ventriculo-peritoneal
shunting
should
be
considered
in
those
with
hydrocephalus
failing
medical
management.
The
single
most
important
determinant
of
outcome
is
the
stage
of
tuberculous
meningitis
at
which
treatment
has
been
started.Keywords:

disease
caused
by
Mycobacterium
tuberculosis
is
highly
devastating,
and
accounts
for
approximately
1%
of
all
cases
of
tuberculosis
(TB).
It
carries
a
high
mortality
and
a
distressing
level
of
neurological
morbidity,
and
disproportionately
afflicts
children
and
human

The
purpose
of
this
review
is
to
highlight
the
current
epidemiological,
clinical,
diagnostic,
and
therapeutic
aspects
of
CNS
tuberculosis.The
global
epidemiologic
burden
of
TBWorld
Health
Organisation
estimates
that
9.27
million
new
cases
of
TB
occurred
in
2007
(139/100,000
population),
compared
with
9.24
million
new
cases
(140/100,000
population)
in
2006
world
over1.
India,
China,
Indonesia,
Nigeria,
and
South
Africa
rank
first
to
fifth
in
the
total
number
of
incident
cases.
Among
the
15
countries
with
the
highest
estimated
TB
incidence
rates,
13
are
in
Africa,
a
phenomenon
linked
to
the
effect
of
high
rates
of
HIV
coinfection
on
the
natural
history
of
TB2.
Incidence
rates
are
falling
world
over
except
in
Eastern
Europe,
where
it
is
stable
and
increasing
only
in
African
countries
with
a
low
prevalence
of
HIV1,3.Among
the
9.27
million
incident
cases
of
TB
in
2007,
an
estimated
1.37
million
(14.8%)
are
HIV-positive1.
The
global
number
of
incident
HIV-positive
TB
cases
is
estimated
to
have
peaked
in
2005
at
1.39
million.
The
relative
risk
of
developing
TB
in
HIV-positive
people
compared
to
HIV-negative
people
(the
incidence
rate
ratio)
is
20.6
in
countries
with
a
HIV
prevalence
greater
than
1%
in
the
general
population,
about
26.7
where
HIV
prevalence
range
from
0.1%
and
1%,
and
36.7
in
countries
with
a
prevalence
less
than
0.1%.4PrevalenceAbout
13.7
million
prevalent
cases
were
estimated
in
2007
(206/100,000
population),
a
slight
decrease
from
13.9
million
in
2006.
The
global
prevalence
of
TB
is
estimated
to
have
been
declining
since
1990.
This
decline
is
in
marked
contrast
to
the
increase
in
TB
incidence
in
the
1990s,
which
can
be
explained
by
a
decrease
in
the
average
duration
of
disease
as
the
fraction
of
cases
treated
in
the
DOTS
programs
increased
and
a
comparatively
short
duration
of
disease
among
HIV-positive
cases
specifically
with
limited
access
to
antiretroviral
therapy
(ART).
The
duration
of
TB
among
HIV-positive
patients
is
relatively
short
for
in
people
with
advanced
HIV
infection,
the
progression
to
severe
tuberculosis
is
rapid,
with
a
marked
reduction
in
life
expectancy5.
Infection
of
the
CNS
is
one
of
the
most
devastating
clinical
manifestations
of
tuberculosis.
In
an
American
epidemiological
study
of
extrapulmonary
tuberculosis,
up
to
10%
of
cases
showed
CNS
involvement6,
while
CDC
data
indicated
that
6.3%
of
extrapulmonary
cases
(1.3%
of
total
tuberculosis
cases)
had
CNS
TB.7
In
a
Taiwan
study,
1.5%
of
TB
deaths
between
1997
and
2001
were
attributable
to
CNS
disease,
a
percentage
that
had
increased
from
previous
years8.Risk
factorsRisk
factors
for
CNS
tuberculosis
include
age
(children>
adults)
HIV-coinfection9,
malnutrition,
recent
measles
in
children10,
alcoholism,
malignancies,
the
use
of
immunosuppressive
agents
in
adults
and
disease
prevalence
in
the
community11,12.Clinical
featuresIn
most
patients
with
tuberculous
meningitis
there
is
a
history
of
vague
ill
health
lasting
2–8
weeks
prior
to
the
development
of
meningeal
irritation.
These
nonspecific
symptoms
include
malaise,
anorexia,
fatigue,
fever,
myalgias,
and
headache.
Adults
with
tuberculous
meningitis
(TBM)
can
often
present
with
the
classic
meningitis
symptoms
of
fever,
headache
and
stiff
neck
along
with
focal
neurological
deficits,
behavioral
changes,
and
alterations
in
consciousness14.
A
history
of
tuberculosis
is
elicited
in
only
approximately
10%
of
patients14.
The
presence
of
active
pulmonary
tuberculosis
on
chest
X-
ray
ranges
from
30
to
50%.
Patients
coinfected
with
HIV
do
not
seem
to
have
an
altered
presentation
of
TBM15.
About
10%
of
cases
with
TBM
have
some
form
of
spinal
tuberculosis.

that

as

lesions
in
the
territories
of
the
middle

artery
perforating
vessels
are
termed
as
tuberculous
vasculopathy.
Vessel
pathology
appears
to
be
a
consequence
of
its
immersion
in
the
local
inflammatory
exudate.
Infiltrative,
proliferative
and
necrotising
vessel
pathologies
have
been
described,
leading
to
luminal
thrombosis.
There
is
some
evidence
that
vasospasm
may
mediate
strokes
early
in
the
course
of
the
disease
and
proliferative
intimal
disease
later
strokes16.Children
with
TBM
often
present
with
fever,
stiff
neck,
seizures,
and
abdominal
symptoms
such
as
nausea
and
vomiting.
Headache
occurs
less
often
than
in
adults.
Depending
on
the
stage
of
presentation,
neurological
symptoms
range
from
lethargy
and
agitation
to
coma.
TBM
in
children
develops
most
often
within
3
months
of
primary
tuberculosis
infection17.
A
family
history
of
tuberculosis
can
be
identified
in
approximately
50
to
60%
of
children,
and
a
positive
tuberculin
skin
test
is
found
in
approximately
30
to
50%.
16
In
children
particularly,
there
appears
to
be
a
close
association
with
disseminated
(miliary)
tuberculosis17.

of
TBM.
The
sixth
cranial
nerve
is
most
commonly
affected19.
Vision
loss
due
to
optic

involvement
may
occasionally
be
a
dominant
presenting
illness.
Optochiasmatic
arachnoiditis,
third
ventricular
compression
of
optic
chiasma
(if
hydrocephalus
develops),
optic
nerve
granuloma
are
possible
factors
for
vision
loss
in
these
patients.
Ophthalmoscopic
examination
may
reveal
papilloedema.
Funduscopy
may
reveal
choroid
tubercles,
yellow
lesions
with
indistinct
borders
present
either
singly
or
in
clusters.
These
choroid
tubercles
are
more
frequent
with
tuberculous
meningitis
associated
with
miliary
tuberculosis
and
are
virtually
pathognomonic
(table
3),
although
they
are
present
in
only
10%
of
patients
in
whom
the
meningitis
is
not
associated
with

Encephalopathy
(TBE)TBE
is
a
rare
outcome
usually
more
common
in
younger
population
and
is
characterized
by
diffuse
brain
edema
and
demyelination,
which
usually
is
extensive27.
Microscopically
it
is
characterized
by
microvascular
necrosis
with
perivascular
macrophage
reaction
and
demyelination
along
with
focal
glial
nodules
in
the
white
matter
and
occasional
hemorrhagic
lesions.
Impaired
consciousness,
seizures,
disseminated
intravascular
coagulation,
signs
and
symptoms
of
meningitis
with
or
without
spinal
fluid
changes
characterize
this
syndrome.
This
syndrome
may
be
one
of
the
leading
causes
of
neurologic
devastation
and
death
in
CNS
TB
patients
with
high
alcohol
intake.Spinal
tuberculosisInvolvement
of
the
spine
occurs
in
less
than
1%
of
TB
patients
and
it
can
be
secondary
to
Pott's
spine
or
as
non-osseous
spinal
cord
tuberculosis
or
spinal
tuberculous
meningitis.
It
is
a
leading
cause
of
paraplegia
in
developing
nations.
In
Pott's
spine
infection
in
the
vertebral
bodies
usually
starts
in
cancellous
bone
adjacent
to
an
intervertebral
disc
or
anteriorly
under
the
periosteum
of
the
vertebral
body;
the
neural
arch
is
rarely
affected.
Vertebral
destruction
leads
to
collapse
of
the
body
of
the
vertebra
along
with
anterior
wedging.
Spinal
cord
compression
in
Pott's
spine
is
mainly
caused
by
pressure
from
a
paraspinal
abscess.
Neurological
deficits
may
also
result
from
dural
invasion
by
granulation
tissue
and
compression
from
the
debris
of
sequestrated
bone,
a
destroyed
intervertebral
disc,
or
a
dislocated
vertebra.
Rarely,
vascular
insufficiency
in
the
territory
of
the
anterior
spinal
artery
has
also
been
suggested.
Neurological
involvement
can
occur
at
any
stage
of
Pott's
spine
and
even
years
later,
when
there
has
been
apparent
healing,
because
of
stretching
of
the
cord
in
the
deformed
spinal
canal.
The
thoracic
spine
is
involved
in
about
65%
of
cases,
and
the
lumbar,
cervical
and
thoracolumbar
spine
in
about
20%,
10%
and
5%,
respectively.
The
atlanto-axial
region
may
also
be
involved
in
less
than
1%
of
cases.
Males
are
affected
more
often
than
females
in
most
series,
and
the
disease
generally
affects
young
persons.Typically,
there
is
a
history
of
local
pain,
tenderness
over
the
affected
spine
or
even
overlying
bony
deformity
in
the
form
of
gibbus.
Paravertebral
abscess
may
be
palpated
on
the
back
of
a
number
of
patients.
These
patients
usually
have
acute
or
subacute,
progressive,
spastic
type
of
sensorimotor
paraparesis.
The
incidence
of
paraparesis
in
patients
with
Pott's
spine
varies
from
27%
to
47%.28Non-osseous
spinal
cord
tuberculosis
can
occur
in
the
form
of
tuberculomas.
Dastur
29
reviewed
74
cases
of
tuberculous
paraplegia
without
evidence
of
Pott's
disease
and
observed
that
extradural
tuberculomas
occurred
in
64%
while
arachnoid
lesions
without
dural
involvement,
and
subdural/extramedullary
lesions
occured
in
8%
of
patients
in
each
group.
Intramedullary
tuberculomas
are
extremely
rarely
reported
and
are
frequently
located
in
the
thoracic
region.
More
than
one
site
in
the
spinal
cord
may
also
be
affected.
The
clinical
features
are
indistinguishable
from
those
of
any
extramedullary
or
intramedullary
tumour,
although
acute
worsening
may
occur.
Non-osseous
spinal
cord
tuberculomas
may
increase
in
size
while
the
patient
is
on
antituberculous
therapy.A
predominantly
spinal
form
of
tuberculous
meningitis
may
result
from
rupture
of
Rich's
focus
into
the
spinal
arachnoid
space
rather
than
the
basal
meninges.
The
acute
form
presents
with
fever,
headache,
and
radiating
root
pains,
accompanied
by
myelopathy.
The
chronic
form,
usually
localised
to
a
few
segments,
presents
with
progressive
spinal
cord
compression
and
may
suggest
a
spinal
cord
tumour.
The
characteristic
MRI
features
include
CSF
loculation
and
obliteration
of
the
spinal
subarachnoid
space
with
loss
of
outline
of
spinal
cord
in
the
cervicothoracic
region
and
matting
of
nerve
roots
in
the
lumbar
region.
Spinal
forms

Reconstitution
Inflammatory
Syndrome
and
TBTwo
forms
of
Immune
Reconstitution
Inflammatory
Syndrome
(IRIS)
are
recognized
in
the
case
of
TB.
(a)
Paradoxical
TB-IRIS
occurs
in
patients
diagnosed
with
TB
and
established
on
TB
treatment
before
ART,
who
then
manifest
with
recurrent
or
new
TB
symptoms
and
clinical
manifestations
after
ART
initiation.(b)
Unmasking
TB-IRIS
occurs
in
patients
who
are
not
on
TB
treatment
when
they
start
ART,
and
who
then
have
an
unusually
inflammatory
presentation
of
TB
in
the
first
3
months
of
ART
30.Paradoxical
TB-IRIS
reactions
during
TB
treatment
(new
or
recurrent
TB
symptoms,
or
signs
occurring
after
initial
response
to
treatment)
occur
in
patients
not
infected
with
HIV-1
and
patients
infected
with
HIV-1
and
not
on
ART.
Manifestations
include
recurrent
fevers,
worsening
pulmonary
infiltrates,
enlarging
pleural
effusions,
the
development
of
TBM,
new
or
enlarging
tuberculomas,
or
tuberculous
lesions
developing
at
other
anatomic
sites.
The
pathogenesis
has
variably
been
attributed
to
a
combination
of
the
following
factors:
release
of
new
antigen
targets
during
mycobacterial
killing,
hypersensitivity
to
such
antigens,
and
exaggerated
immune
restoration
(following
TB-induced
immunosuppression)
occurring
on
TB
treatment.
The
development
of
paradoxical
reactions
in
patients
not
infected
with
HIV-1
is
associated
with
greater
increases
in
total
lymphocyte
count
on
TB
treatment.
Paradoxical
reactions
are
also
far
more
frequent
in
the
period
after
ART
initiation
than
in
patients
not
infected
with
HIV-1
and
patients
infected
with
HIV-1
and
not
on
ART
(36%
vs
2%
vs
7%,
respectively,
in
one
study31.
The
risk
factors
for
paradoxical
IRIS
are
disseminated
TB,
low
CD4
count
before
ART,
and
shorter
interval
from
TB
treatment
to
ART.It
is
important
to
investigate
for
other
opportunistic
infections
and
malignancies,
TB
treatment
failure
(due
to
nonadherence,
TB
drug
resistance,
or
malabsorption
of
TB
drugs),
or
drug
reaction.
In
addition,
TB-IRIS
may
develop
in
patients
with
undiagnosed
rifampicin
resistance,
clinically
indistinguishable
from
TB-IRIS
which
occurs
in
patients
with
drug-susceptible
disease.
If
possible,
drug
susceptibility
testing,
preferably
a
rapid
diagnostic
assay,
should
be
performed
in
all
patients
presenting
with
paradoxical
TB-IRIS.
Corticosteroids
have
been
used
for
management
of
TB-IRIS
when
alternative
diagnoses
have
been
excluded.
Unmasking
TB-IRIS
is
less
well
characterized
than
paradoxical
TB-IRIS,
with
fewer
cases
reported.
A
subset
of
these
cases
presenting
with
heightened
intensity
of
clinical
manifestations,
particularly
when
there
is
evidence
of
a
marked
inflammatory
component,
during
the
first
3
months
of
ART
are
termed
as
“unmasking
TB-IRIS.”Go

diagnostic
utility

to

The
performance
of
the
tuberculin

for
the
diagnosis
of
tuberculosis
varies
according
to
age,
vaccination
with
BCG,
nutritional
status,
HIV
infection,
and
technique

TST
like
interferon-gamma
release
assays
may
provide
indication
of
previous
tuberculosis
infection;
neither
is
sufficiently
sensitive
nor
specific
to
diagnose
active
disease40.Interferon-
γ
release
assays
(IGRAs):
A
major
advance
in
recent
times
has
been
the
development
of
T-cell-based
interferon-
γ
release
assays
(IGRAs).
IGRAs
are
in
vitro
tests
that
are
based
on
interferon-γ(IFN-
γ)
release
after
T-cell
stimulation
by
antigens
(such
as
early
secreted
antigenic
target
6
[ESAT6]
and
culture
filtrate
protein
10
[CFP10])
that
are
more
specific
to
MTB
than
the
purified
protein
derivative
(PPD).
Two
IGRAs
are
currently
available
as
commercial
kits.
Systematic
reviews
have
reported
strong
evidence
that
IGRAs
have
high
specificity
that
is
unaffected
by
bacille
Calmette-
Guérin
(BCG)
vaccination41,
42.
TST,
in
contrast,
has
high
specificity
in
populations
who
have
not
been
vaccinated
with
BCG
but
specificity
is
modest
and
inconsistent
in
populations
vaccinated
with
BCG.
The
high
specificity
of
IGRAs
is
proving
to
be
useful
in
individuals
vaccinated
with
BCG43.
IGRAs
may
be
excellent
options
in
these
populations
and
it
seems
to
be
at
least
as
sensitive
as
TST42.
Both
these
immune-based
tests
merely
indicate
a
cellular
immune
response
to
recent
or
remote
sensitization
with
MTB.
IFN-γ
can
be
easily
induced
in
peripheral
blood
monocytes
or
whole
blood
through
antigenic
stimulation
in
sufficient
quantities
that
it
can
be
detected
using
simple
technologies,
such
as
ELISA.
IGRA
tests
rely
on
detecting
elevated
IFN-γ
production
after
stimulation
with
antigens
(ESAT-6,
CFP10).
Because
these
antigens
are
largely
restricted
to
members
of
the
MTB
complex,
the
tests
are
not
confounded
by
BCG
or
environmental
mycobacteria.
Because
IGRAs
cannot
distinguish
between
latent
and
active
TB,
a
positive
IGRA
result
may
not
necessarily
indicate
active
TB.
A
negative
IGRA
result
would
not
conclusively
rule
out
active
disease
in
an
individual
suspected
to
have
TB
(similar
to
the
results
of
a
TST).
About
50%
of
patients
with
culture-confirmed
TBM
had
no
detectable
MTB
-specific
interferon-gamma
producing
lymphocytes
in
peripheral
blood
at
presentation40.The
use
of
IGRAs
is
steadily
increasing
in
countries
with
low
or
intermediate
incidence.
Despite
the
large
number
of
publications
on
IGRAs,
evidence
is
still
limited
on
the
prognostic
value
of
these
tests,
and
their
added
value
in
TB
diagnosis44.
There
is
growing
evidence
that
the
performance
of
IGRAs
varies
between
countries
with
high
and
low
incidence
of
TB45.
Their
role,
if
any,
seems
to
be
limited
in
low
income
countries
with
a
high
TB
burden.ADAADA
is
associated
largely
with
lymphocytic
proliferation
and
differentiation
and
is
considered
to
be
a
marker
of
cell-mediated
immunity46.
The
measured
sensitivities
and
specificities
of
ADA
in
the
CSF
range
from
44
to
100%
and
71
to
100%,
respectively47.
In
one
study,
ADA
was
not
valuable
in
distinguishing
TBM
in
patients
with
HIV
infection.48
Standardized
cutoffs
of
ADA
values
for
the
diagnosis
of
TBM
have
not
been
established,
and
the
values
used
in
various
studies
ranged
from
>5.0
to
>15
IU/liter.
CSF
ADA
measurements
have
been
found
to
be
useful
in
predicting
poor
neurological
outcomes
among
pediatric
TBM
cases49.
Raised
ADA
activity
in
the
CSF
of
patients
with
CNS
TB
lacks
specificity.
High
CSF
ADA

has
been
reported
from

with

malaria,
brucellosis,
pyogenic

acidTuberculostearic
acid
is
a
fatty
acid
component
of
the
M.
tuberculosis
cell
wall52.
Although
its
estimation
has
good
sensitivity
and
specificity
in
limited
studies,
the
requirement
for
expensive
equipment
has
limited
its
clinical
use.Radiological
EvaluationEvery
patient
with
TBM
should
preferably
be
evaluated
with
contrast
enhanced
CT
imaging
before
the
start
or
within
the
first
48
hours
of
treatment35.
Early
brain
CT
can
help
diagnose
TBM,
and
will
provide
important
baseline
information
regarding
surgical
interventions
for
hydrocephalus.
Choroid
plexus
enhancement
with
ventricular
enlargement
on
imaging
is
highly
suggestive
of
TBM.
In
TBM,
MRI
shows
diffuse,
thick,
meningeal
enhancement.
Cerebral
infarcts
can
be
seen
in
nearly
30%
of
cases53.
A
study
from
South
Africa
reported
that
the
combination
of
hydrocephalus,
basal
enhancement
and
infarction
was
100%
specific
and
41%
sensitive
for
the
diagnosis
of
childhood
TBM,
although
the
authors
suggested
pre-contrast
hyperdensity
in
the
basal
cisterns
as
the
best
predictor
of
TBM54.Contrast
enhanced
MRI
is
generally
considered
as
the
modality
of
choice.
It
is
useful
for
assessment
of
the
location
of
lesions
and
their
margins,
as
well
as
ventriculitis,
meningitis
and
spinal
involvement
(sensitivity
86%,
specificity
90%)55.
A
large
lipid,
lactate
peak
has
been
used
to
specifically
identify
tuberculomas
by
magnetic
resonance
spectroscopy56.
All
patients
should
have
a
chest-X-ray
as
part
of
the
diagnostic
assessment35.
Serial
transcranial
doppler
ultrasonography
(TCD)
with
blood
flow

and
pulsatility
index
(PI)
measurments,
can
be
efficiently
utilized
to
prognosticate
outcome
in
tuberculous
meningitis-related
vasculopathy.
In
early
phase
I
vasculopathy
TCD
reveals
increased
Vm
and
normal
to
moderately
decreased
PI
and
these
patients
have
reversible
ischemic
deficits
while
late
phase
III
is
characterized
by
almost
absent
blood
flow
in
one
or
more
basal
arteries
and,
accordingly,
by
associated
brain
tissue
infarction
and
permanent
severe
neurological
deficit
or
fatal
outcome57.Treatment
of
CNS
TBThe
first
combination
therapy
for
TB
consisted
of
para-aminosalicylic
acid
(PAS)
and
isoniazid
(H)
in
addition
to
streptomycin,
given
for
24
months,
and
it
became
the
basis
for
treatment
of
TB
in
the
developed
world
for
about
a
decade.
In
the
mid
1960s,
PAS
was
replaced
by
ethambutol
(E),
a
better-tolerated
drug,
and
the
treatment
duration
was
reduced
from
24
to
18
months.
In
the
late
1960s
rifampicin-containing
regimen
including
isoniazid,
ethambutol,
and
streptomycin
offered
a
predictable
cure
in
more
than
95%
of
patients
with
9-
to
12-month
duration
of
therapy.
In
the
early
1980s
addition
of
pyrazinamide
(Z)
in
the
intensive
phase
of
treatment,
decreased
the
duration
of
a
fully
orally
administered
treatment
to
6
to
8
months.
Studies
conducted
in
East
Africa
showed
that
the
relapse
rate
after
a
6-month
regimen
was
reduced
from
22%
to
8%
by
the
addition
of
pyrazinamide,
and
to
3%
by
the
addition
of
rifampicin58.Since
the
1980s
the
6-
to
8-month
regimen,
using
a
4-drug
combination
(HRZE)
in
the
initial
phase
followed
by
a
2-drug
combination
(HR
or
HE)
in
the
continuation
phase,
has
been
widely
accepted59.
In
2004
the
results
of
a
multicenter
randomized
clinical
trial,
showed
higher
efficacy
for
the
6-month
regimen
(2
months
of
HRZE
plus
4
months
of
HR:
2HRZE/4HR)
compared
with
the
8-month
therapy
(2HRZE/6HE)60.
The
recommended
first-line
treatment
agents
for
all
forms
of
CNS
tuberculosis
are
Isoniazid,
Rifampicin,
Pyrazinamide
and
Ethambutol
taken
daily
either
individually

should

Therapy
should
be
extended
to
at
least
12
months
in
those
who
fail

or
if

interruptions
have
occurred
for

Isoniazid
penetrates
the
CSF
freely61
and
has
potent
early
bactericidal
activity.
At
standard
doses
isoniazid
achieves
CSF
levels
10–15
times
the
minimum
inhibitory
concentration
of
M.
tuberculosis62.
The
main
disadvantage
of
INH
is
that
resistance
develops
quite
quickly
when
used
as
monotherapy
though
this
does
not
seem
to
happen
when
it
is
used
to
eradicate
the
organism
in
a
patient
who
has
become
infected
but
has
not
yet
developed
overt
signs
or
symptoms
of
infection
(chemoprophylaxis).
Pyridoxine
is
extremely
effective
in
stopping
the
seizures,
reversing
the
coma,
and
correcting
the
metabolic
acidosis
triggered
by
any
acute
overdose
of
isoniazid.
Treatment
is
best
given
as
a
relatively
rapid
intravenous
(IV)
infusion,
the
standard
dose
being
one
mg
of
pyridoxine
for
every
mg
of
isoniazid
the
patient
is
thought
to
have
taken63.
Crushed
tablets
can
be
given
down
a
nasogastric
tube
if
no
IV
preparation
is
readily
available.
Prompt
treatment
is
called
for
because
INH
dose
in
excess
of
90
mg/kg
is
extremely
likely
to
trigger
recurrent
seizure
activity,
which
can
be
fatal64.
Rifampicin
penetrates
the
CSF
less
well
(maximum
concentrations
around
30%
of
plasma),
but
the
high
mortality
from
rifampicin
resistant
TBM
has
confirmed
its
key
role
in
the
treatment
of
CNS
disease65.
The
incidence
of
ethambutol
induced
optic
neuritis
is
less
than
3%
at
the
standard
dose
of
15–20
mg/kg
though
it
is
a
concern,
especially
when
treating
comatose
patients66.
Fluoroquinolones
are
an
effective
fourth
agent
(if
ethambutol
is
contraindicated),
but
should
be
avoided
in
women
who
are
pregnant
or
breastfeeding
and
prolonged
fluoroquinolone
therapy
is
not
advised
for
children67.
Interruptions
in
treatment
are
an
independent
risk
factor
for
death
from
TBM68.Rationale
use
of
steroids
in
CNS
TBAll
patients
with
TBM
may
receive
adjunctive
corticosteroids
regardless
of
disease
severity
at
presentation.
Adults
(>14
years)
should
start
treatment
with
dexamethasone
0.4
mg/kg/24
hours
with
a
tapering
course
over
6
to
8
weeks.
Children
(d″14
years)
should
be
given
prednisolone
4mg/kg/24
hrs
(or
equivalent
dose
dexamethasone:
0.6
mg/kg/24
hrs)
for
4
weeks,
followed
by
a
tapering
course
over
4
weeks69.
The
role
of
routine
adjunctive
corticosteroids
for
all
patients
with
tuberculomas
without
meningitis,
or
with
spinal
cord
tuberculosis
is
arguable
albeit
corticosteroids
may
be
helpful
in
those
patients
whose
symptoms
are
not
controlled,
or
are
worsening,
on
anti-tuberculosis
therapy.
Doses
similar
to
those
used
for
TBM
should
be
given.
Thalidomide
may
be
helpful
in
patients
with
tuberculomas
that
are
not
responding
to
antituberculosis
drugs
and
high
dose
corticosteroids70.Management
of
CNS
TB
in
HIV
infectedCNS
tuberculosis
in
HIV
infected
patients
should
be
managed
with
the
same
anti-tuberculosis
drug
regimen
as
that
recommended
for
HIV
uninfected
individuals;
whenever
possible
the
regimen
should
include
rifampicin.
Adjunctive
corticosteroids
are
recommended
for
those
with
TBM
and
HIV
infection.
Starting

upon
balancing
the
risks

early
and
opportunistic

If

cells/µl
it
is
better
to
defer
HIV
treatment
as
long
as
possible,
ideally
until
end
of
tuberculosis
treatment35.
Start
anti-retroviral
treatment
(ART)
if
the
CD4
count
falls
below
200
cells/ìl
during
tuberculosis
treatment.
If
CD4
is
100–200
cells/ìL
start
ART
after
approximately
2
months
of
anti-tuberculosis
treatment
so
that
risk
of
IRIS
is
minimised.
If
CD4
is
<
100
cells/ìL
start
ART
within
the
first
2
weeks
of
anti-tuberculosis
treatment.
Rifampicin
will
induce
the
metabolism
of
protease
inhibitors,
delavirdine
and
nevirapine
reducing
the
level
of
these
drugs.
When
possible,
treat
with
rifampicin
and
a
non-nucleoside
reverse
transcriptase
inhibitor
(NNRTI),
preferably
efavirenz
but
the
dose
of
efavirenz
should
be
increased
to
800mg.
Rifabutin
should
be
used
if
treatment
with
a
protease
inhibitor
(PI)
is
required,
but
at
a
reduced
dose
(usually
150mg
3
times
per
week).
If
efavirenz
and
rifabutin
are
co-administered,
a
450
mg
daily
dosage
of
rifabutin
is
recommended.Management

Slow
correction
of

either
by
sodium
and
water
replacement
if
the

times
normal
stopping
pyrazinamide,
continuing
isoniazid,
rifampicin,
ethambutol,
and

is
recommended35.
If
serum
albumin
falls,
the
prothrombin
time
rises,
or
the
transaminases
continue
to

isoniazid
and
rifampicin
should
be
withdrawn.
Streptomycin
and
ethambutol
should
be
given,
along
with
moxifloxacin
or
levofloxacin.
Rifampicin

in

a
recent
study
175
patients
with
a
diagnosis
of
antituberculosis
drug-induced
hepatotoxicity
(DIH)
were
randomized
to
receive
1
of
3
different
predefined
reintroduction
regimens
in
which
one
group
were
given
isoniazid,
rifampicin,
and
pyrazinamide
simultaneously
at
full
dosage
from

while
the
other
received
antituberculosis
drugs
in
a
manner
similar
to
that
recommended
in
the
American
Thoracic
Society
guidelines
for
reintroduction
and
the
third
were
administered
drugs
accordance
with
British
Thoracic
Society
guidelines71.
19
patients
(10.9%)
had
recurrence
of
DIH
during
follow-up
and
the
recurrence
rate
was
not
significantly
different
between
the
3
groups.
Pretreatment
serum
albumin
level
was
the
only
statistically
significant
predictor
of
future
recurrence
of
DIH
on
reintroduction
of
antituberculosis
drugs.
Patients
with
life-threatening
tuberculosis
can
be
reintroduced
simultaneously
at
full
dosage
safely
from
day
1
with
all
3
of
the
potentially
hepatotoxic
drugs
(isoniazid,
rifampicin,
and
pyrazinamide).Role
of
neurosurgeryHydrocephalus,
tuberculous
brain
abscess
(TBA),
and
vertebral
tuberculosis
with
cord
compression
are
all
indications
for
urgent
neurosurgical
referral
though
early
hydrocephalus
and
tuberculous
brain
abscess
can
be
successfully
treated
by
drugs
alone
.
So
early
recognition
and
timely
treatment
is
critical
in
avoiding
the
surgery.
TBA
occurs
in
only
4%
to
8%
of
patients
with
CNS
TB
who
do
not
have
HIV
infection
but
in
20%
of
patients
who
do
have
HIV
infection.
The
aim
of
surgical
management
of
TBA
is
to
reduce
the
size
of
the
space-occupying
lesion
and
thereby
diminish
intracranial
pressure
and
to
eradicate
the
pathogen.
Early
surgical
drainage
and
chemotherapy
are
considered
the
most
appropriate
treatment
for
TBA
and
can
be
therapeutic
as
well
as
diagnostic.
It
should
be
carefully
planned
and
individualized
according
to
the
patient's
clinical
condition,
anatomic
localization,
and
the
number
of
lesions.
Early
anti
tuberculous
therapy
(ATT)
must
be
considered
in
all
cases
of
suspected
TBA
even
before
surgery,
in
order
to
reduce
the
risk
of
postoperative
meningitis.
An
open
surgical
excision
is
an
appropriate
treatment
option
for
large,
multiloculated
cerebellar
lesions
that
cause
brain
herniation
and
also
in
those
that
do
not
respond
to
aspiration
while
stereotactic-guided
aspiration
is
preferred
in
eloquent
or
deep-seated
areas
such
as
the
hypothalamus,
thalamus,
or
deep
temporal
regions
in
order
to
prevent
severe
neurological
sequelae.
The
main
disadvantage
of
the
latter
option
is
the
need
for
repeated
procedures
in
as
many
as
70%
of
patients,
and
the
high
risk
of
rupture
into
ventricles
or
the
subarachnoid
space,
which
could
lead
to
ventricular
ependymitis
or
meningitis
and
worsening
of
neurological
deficits.
An
early
surgical
procedure
can
improve
the
efficacy
of
ATT,
promote
a
better
clinical
response
after
reduction
of
bacillary
load
and
reduce
mortality72.
Hydrocephalus,
either
communicating(more
common)
or
obstructive,
is
one
of
the
commonest
complications
of
TBM
occurring
in
up
to
85%
of
children
with
the
disease
in
whom
it
is
more
severe
than
in
adults.
Patients
with
TBM
and
hydrocephalus
who
have
a
Glascow
coma
scale
(GCS)
of
15
(with
or
without
focal
neurological
deficit)
could
be
tried
for
a
few
days
or
a
week
on
diuretics
and
steroids
with
close
monitoring
to
detect
any
worsening
or
lack
of
improvement
and
a
shunt
should
promptly
be
offered
in
case
of
failure
of
medical
management.
Ventriculoperitoneal
shunt
is
the
procedure
of
choice
if
the
duration
of
illness
is
<4
weeks
while
endoscopic
third
ventriculostomy
or
ventriculoperitoneal
shunt
can
be
offered
if
duration
>4weeks.
Patients
with
GCS
>8
and
<14
are
better
off
with
an
early
shunt
procedure
and
so
are
those
with
GCS
>3
and
<8
who
improve
within
48
hours
after
an
external
ventricular
drainage
(EDV)
while
those
with
GCS
>3
and
<8
who
fail
the
EDV
trial
are
unlikely
to
benefit
with
shunt
and
are
managed
conservatively73.
Urgent
surgical
decompression
should
be
considered
in
all
those
with
extradural
lesions
causing
paraparesis74.Prognosis
and
sequelaeThe
single
most
important
determinant
of
outcome,
for
both
survival
and
sequelae,
is
the
stage
of
tuberculous
meningitis
at
which
treatment
has
been
started
others
being
extremes
of
age,
malnutrition,
hydrocephalus,
focal
neurological
deficit
,presence
of
miliary
disease
,
underlying
debilitating
disease
and
alcoholism.
If
treatment
is
started
in
stage
I,
mortality
and
morbidity
is
very
low,
while
in
stage
III
almost
50%
of
patients
die,
and
those
who
recover
may
have
some
form
of
neurological
deficit75.
Survivors
manifest
a
variety
of
neurological
sequelae.
Intracranial
calcification
develops
in
20%
to
48%
of
patients
with
tuberculous
meningitis,
usually
becoming
detectable
2
to
3
years
after
the
onset
of
the
disease76.Go

recognition
and
timely
treatment
of

is
critical

the
considerable
mortality

morbidity
associated
with
the

is
to
be
prevented.

involvement,
one
of
the
most
devastating
clinical
manifestations
of
tuberculosis
(TB)
is
noted
in
5
to
10%
of
extrapulmonary
TB
cases,
and
accounts
for
approximately
1%
of
all
TB
cases.
Definitive
diagnosis
of
tuberculous
meningitis
(TBM)
depends
upon
the
detection
of
the
tubercle
bacilli
in
the
CSF.
Every
patient
with
TBM
should
preferably
be
evaluated
by
imaging
with
contrast
enhanced
CT
either
before
or
within
the
first
48
hours
of
treatment.
An
extra-neural
focus
of
tuberculosis
should
be
sought
clinically
and
radiologically
in
all
patients
with
CNS
TB
as
it
may
indicate
safer
and
more
accessible
sites
for
diagnostic
samplings.
A
minimum
of
10
months
treatment
is
warranted,
prompted
by
the
uncertain
influences
of
disease
severity,
CNS
drug
penetration,
undetected
drug
resistance
and
patient
compliance.
All
patients
with
TB
meningitis
may
receive
adjunctive
corticosteroids
at
presentation
regardless
of
disease
severity
even
for
those
with
HIV
infection.
Drug
resistance
is
strongly
associated
with
previous
treatment.
The
key
principle
of
managing
drug-resistant
TB
is
never
to
add
a
single
drug
to
a
failing
regimen.
Early
ventriculo-peritoneal
shunting
should
be
considered
in
those
with
hydrocephalus
failing
medical
management.
The
single
most
important
determinant
of
outcome
is
the
stage
of
tuberculous
meningitis
at
which
treatment
has
been
started.Keywords:

disease
caused
by

tuberculosis
is
highly
devastating,
and
accounts
for
approximately
1%
of
all
cases
of
tuberculosis
(TB).
It
carries
a
high
mortality
and
a
distressing
level
of
neurological
morbidity,
and
disproportionately
afflicts
children
and

The
purpose
of
this
review
is
to
highlight
the
current
epidemiological,
clinical,
diagnostic,
and
therapeutic
aspects
of
CNS
tuberculosis.The
global
epidemiologic
burden
of
TBWorld
Health
Organisation
estimates
that
9.27
million
new
cases
of
TB
occurred
in
2007
(139/100,000
population),
compared
with
9.24
million
new
cases
(140/100,000
population)
in
2006
world
over1.
India,
China,
Indonesia,
Nigeria,
and
South
Africa
rank
first
to
fifth
in
the
total
number
of
incident
cases.
Among
the
15
countries
with
the
highest
estimated
TB
incidence
rates,
13
are
in
Africa,
a
phenomenon
linked
to
the
effect
of
high
rates
of
HIV
coinfection
on
the
natural
history
of
TB2.
Incidence
rates
are
falling
world
over
except
in
Eastern
Europe,
where
it
is
stable
and
increasing
only
in
African
countries
with
a
low
prevalence
of
HIV1,3.Among
the
9.27
million
incident
cases
of
TB
in
2007,
an
estimated
1.37
million
(14.8%)
are
HIV-positive1.
The
global
number
of
incident
HIV-positive
TB
cases
is
estimated
to
have
peaked
in
2005
at
1.39
million.
The
relative
risk
of
developing
TB
in
HIV-positive
people
compared
to
HIV-negative
people
(the
incidence
rate
ratio)
is
20.6
in
countries
with
a
HIV
prevalence
greater
than
1%
in
the
general
population,
about
26.7
where
HIV
prevalence
range
from
0.1%
and
1%,
and
36.7
in
countries
with
a
prevalence
less
than
0.1%.4PrevalenceAbout
13.7
million
prevalent
cases
were
estimated
in
2007
(206/100,000
population),
a
slight
decrease
from
13.9
million
in
2006.
The
global
prevalence
of
TB
is
estimated
to
have
been
declining
since
1990.
This
decline
is
in
marked
contrast
to
the
increase
in
TB
incidence
in
the
1990s,
which
can
be
explained
by
a
decrease
in
the
average
duration
of
disease
as
the
fraction
of
cases
treated
in
the
DOTS
programs
increased
and
a
comparatively
short
duration
of
disease
among
HIV-positive
cases
specifically
with
limited
access
to
antiretroviral
therapy
(ART).
The
duration
of
TB
among
HIV-positive
patients
is
relatively
short
for
in
people
with
advanced
HIV
infection,
the
progression
to
severe
tuberculosis
is
rapid,
with
a
marked
reduction
in
life
expectancy5.
Infection
of
the
CNS
is
one
of
the
most
devastating
clinical
manifestations
of
tuberculosis.
In
an
American
epidemiological
study
of
extrapulmonary
tuberculosis,
up
to
10%
of
cases
showed
CNS
involvement6,
while
CDC
data
indicated
that
6.3%
of
extrapulmonary
cases
(1.3%
of
total
tuberculosis
cases)
had
CNS
TB.7
In
a
Taiwan
study,
1.5%
of
TB
deaths
between
1997
and
2001
were
attributable
to
CNS
disease,
a
percentage
that
had
increased
from
previous
years8.Risk
factorsRisk
factors
for
CNS
tuberculosis
include
age
(children>
adults)
HIV-coinfection9,
malnutrition,
recent
measles
in
children10,
alcoholism,
malignancies,
the
use
of
immunosuppressive
agents
in
adults
and
disease
prevalence
in
the
community11,12.Clinical
featuresIn
most
patients
with
tuberculous
meningitis
there
is
a
history
of
vague
ill
health
lasting
2–8
weeks
prior
to
the
development
of
meningeal
irritation.
These
nonspecific
symptoms
include
malaise,
anorexia,
fatigue,
fever,
myalgias,
and
headache.
Adults
with
tuberculous
meningitis
(TBM)
can
often
present
with
the
classic
meningitis
symptoms
of
fever,
headache
and
stiff
neck
along
with
focal
neurological
deficits,
behavioral
changes,
and
alterations
in
consciousness14.
A
history
of
tuberculosis
is
elicited
in
only
approximately
10%
of
patients14.
The
presence
of
active
pulmonary
tuberculosis
on
chest
X-
ray
ranges
from
30
to
50%.
Patients
coinfected
with
HIV
do
not
seem
to
have
an
altered
presentation
of
TBM15.
About
10%
of
cases
with
TBM
have
some
form
of
spinal
tuberculosis.

in

are
termed
as
tuberculous
vasculopathy.
Vessel
pathology
appears
to
be
a
consequence
of
its
immersion
in
the
local
inflammatory
exudate.
Infiltrative,
proliferative
and
necrotising
vessel
pathologies
have
been
described,
leading
to
luminal
thrombosis.
There
is
some
evidence
that
vasospasm
may
mediate
strokes
early
in
the
course
of
the
disease
and
proliferative
intimal
disease
later
strokes16.Children
with
TBM
often
present
with
fever,
stiff
neck,
seizures,
and
abdominal
symptoms
such
as
nausea
and
vomiting.
Headache
occurs
less
often
than
in
adults.
Depending
on
the
stage
of
presentation,
neurological
symptoms
range
from
lethargy
and
agitation
to
coma.
TBM
in
children
develops
most
often
within
3
months
of
primary
tuberculosis
infection17.
A
family
history
of
tuberculosis
can
be
identified
in
approximately
50
to
60%
of
children,
and
a
positive
tuberculin
skin
test
is
found
in
approximately
30
to
50%.
16
In
children
particularly,
there
appears
to
be
a
close
association
with
disseminated
(miliary)
tuberculosis17.

is

Vision

Optochiasmatic
arachnoiditis,

(if

develops),
optic

granuloma
are
possible
factors
for

in
these

reveal
papilloedema.
Funduscopy
may
reveal
choroid
tubercles,
yellow

present
either
singly
or
in

These
choroid
tubercles
are
more
frequent
with
tuberculous

associated
with

tuberculosis
and
are
virtually
pathognomonic
(table

Encephalopathy
(TBE)TBE
is
a
rare
outcome
usually
more
common
in
younger
population
and
is
characterized
by
diffuse
brain
edema
and
demyelination,
which
usually
is
extensive27.
Microscopically
it
is
characterized
by
microvascular
necrosis
with
perivascular
macrophage
reaction
and
demyelination
along
with
focal
glial
nodules
in
the
white
matter
and
occasional
hemorrhagic
lesions.
Impaired
consciousness,
seizures,
disseminated
intravascular
coagulation,
signs
and
symptoms
of
meningitis
with
or
without
spinal
fluid
changes
characterize
this
syndrome.
This
syndrome
may
be
one
of
the
leading
causes
of
neurologic
devastation
and
death
in
CNS
TB
patients
with
high
alcohol
intake.Spinal
tuberculosisInvolvement
of
the
spine
occurs
in
less
than
1%
of
TB
patients
and
it
can
be
secondary
to
Pott's
spine
or
as
non-osseous
spinal
cord
tuberculosis
or
spinal
tuberculous
meningitis.
It
is
a
leading
cause
of
paraplegia
in
developing
nations.
In
Pott's
spine
infection
in
the
vertebral
bodies
usually
starts
in
cancellous
bone
adjacent
to
an
intervertebral
disc
or
anteriorly
under
the
periosteum
of
the
vertebral
body;
the
neural
arch
is
rarely
affected.
Vertebral
destruction
leads
to
collapse
of
the
body
of
the
vertebra
along
with
anterior
wedging.
Spinal
cord
compression
in
Pott's
spine
is
mainly
caused
by
pressure
from
a
paraspinal
abscess.
Neurological
deficits
may
also
result
from

Rarely,

also
been
suggested.
Neurological
involvement
can
occur
at
any
stage
of
Pott's

and
even
years
later,
when
there
has
been
apparent
healing,
because
of
stretching
of
the
cord
in
the
deformed
spinal
canal.
The
thoracic
spine
is
involved
in
about
65%
of
cases,
and
the
lumbar,
cervical
and
thoracolumbar
spine
in
about
20%,
10%
and
5%,
respectively.
The
atlanto-axial
region
may
also
be
involved
in
less
than
1%
of
cases.
Males
are
affected
more
often
than
females
in
most
series,
and
the
disease
generally
affects
young
persons.Typically,
there
is
a

of
local

over

of

Paravertebral
abscess
may
be
palpated
on

of
a
number
of
patients.
These
patients
usually
have
acute
or
subacute,
progressive,
spastic
type
of
sensorimotor
paraparesis.
The
incidence
of
paraparesis
in
patients
with
Pott's
spine
varies
from
27%
to
47%.28Non-osseous

Dastur

74
cases
of

of
Pott's

and
observed
that
extradural
tuberculomas
occurred
in
64%
while
arachnoid
lesions
without
dural
involvement,
and
subdural/extramedullary
lesions
occured
in
8%
of
patients
in
each
group.
Intramedullary
tuberculomas
are
extremely
rarely
reported
and
are
frequently
located
in
the
thoracic
region.
More
than
one
site
in
the
spinal
cord
may
also
be
affected.
The
clinical
features
are
indistinguishable
from
those
of
any
extramedullary
or
intramedullary
tumour,
although
acute
worsening
may
occur.
Non-osseous
spinal
cord
tuberculomas
may
increase
in
size
while
the
patient
is
on
antituberculous
therapy.A
predominantly
spinal
form
of
tuberculous
meningitis
may
result
from
rupture
of
Rich's
focus
into
the
spinal
arachnoid
space
rather
than
the
basal
meninges.
The
acute
form
presents
with
fever,
headache,
and
radiating
root
pains,
accompanied
by
myelopathy.
The
chronic
form,
usually
localised
to
a
few
segments,
presents
with
progressive
spinal
cord
compression
and
may
suggest
a
spinal
cord
tumour.
The
characteristic
MRI
features
include
CSF
loculation
and
obliteration
of
the
spinal
subarachnoid
space
with
loss
of
outline
of
spinal
cord
in
the
cervicothoracic
region
and
matting
of
nerve

in
the

Reconstitution
Inflammatory
Syndrome
and
TBTwo
forms
of
Immune
Reconstitution
Inflammatory
Syndrome
(IRIS)
are
recognized
in
the
case
of
TB.
(a)
Paradoxical
TB-IRIS
occurs
in
patients
diagnosed
with
TB
and
established
on
TB
treatment
before
ART,
who
then
manifest
with
recurrent
or
new
TB
symptoms
and
clinical
manifestations
after
ART
initiation.(b)
Unmasking
TB-IRIS
occurs
in
patients
who
are
not
on
TB
treatment
when
they
start
ART,
and
who
then
have
an
unusually
inflammatory
presentation
of
TB
in
the
first
3
months
of
ART
30.Paradoxical
TB-IRIS
reactions
during
TB
treatment
(new
or
recurrent
TB
symptoms,
or
signs
occurring
after
initial
response
to
treatment)
occur
in
patients
not
infected
with
HIV-1
and
patients
infected
with
HIV-1
and
not
on
ART.
Manifestations
include
recurrent
fevers,
worsening
pulmonary
infiltrates,
enlarging
pleural
effusions,
the
development
of
TBM,
new
or
enlarging
tuberculomas,
or
tuberculous
lesions
developing
at
other
anatomic
sites.
The
pathogenesis
has
variably
been
attributed
to
a
combination
of
the
following
factors:
release
of
new
antigen
targets
during
mycobacterial
killing,
hypersensitivity
to
such
antigens,
and
exaggerated
immune
restoration
(following
TB-induced
immunosuppression)
occurring
on
TB
treatment.
The
development
of
paradoxical
reactions
in
patients
not
infected
with
HIV-1
is
associated
with
greater
increases
in
total
lymphocyte
count
on
TB
treatment.
Paradoxical
reactions
are
also
far
more
frequent
in
the
period
after
ART
initiation
than
in
patients
not
infected
with
HIV-1
and
patients
infected
with
HIV-1
and
not
on
ART
(36%
vs
2%
vs
7%,
respectively,
in
one
study31.
The
risk
factors
for
paradoxical
IRIS
are
disseminated
TB,
low
CD4
count
before
ART,
and
shorter
interval
from
TB
treatment
to
ART.It
is
important
to
investigate
for
other
opportunistic
infections
and
malignancies,
TB
treatment
failure
(due
to
nonadherence,
TB
drug
resistance,
or
malabsorption
of
TB
drugs),
or
drug
reaction.
In
addition,
TB-IRIS
may
develop
in
patients
with
undiagnosed
rifampicin
resistance,
clinically
indistinguishable
from
TB-IRIS
which
occurs
in
patients
with
drug-susceptible
disease.
If
possible,
drug
susceptibility
testing,
preferably
a
rapid
diagnostic
assay,
should
be
performed
in
all
patients
presenting
with
paradoxical
TB-IRIS.
Corticosteroids
have
been
used
for
management
of
TB-IRIS
when
alternative
diagnoses
have
been
excluded.
Unmasking
TB-IRIS
is
less
well
characterized
than
paradoxical
TB-IRIS,
with
fewer
cases
reported.
A
subset
of
these
cases
presenting
with
heightened
intensity
of
clinical
manifestations,
particularly
when
there
is
evidence
of
a
marked
inflammatory
component,
during
the
first
3
months
of
ART
are
termed
as
“unmasking
TB-IRIS.”Go

The

varies
according
to

vaccination

TST
like
interferon-gamma
release
assays
may
provide
indication
of
previous
tuberculosis
infection;
neither
is
sufficiently
sensitive
nor
specific
to
diagnose
active
disease40.Interferon-
γ
release
assays
(IGRAs):
A
major
advance
in
recent
times
has
been
the
development
of
T-cell-based
interferon-
γ
release
assays
(IGRAs).
IGRAs
are
in
vitro
tests
that
are
based
on
interferon-γ(IFN-
γ)
release
after
T-cell
stimulation
by
antigens
(such
as
early
secreted
antigenic
target
6
[ESAT6]
and
culture
filtrate
protein
10
[CFP10])
that
are
more
specific
to
MTB
than
the
purified
protein
derivative
(PPD).
Two
IGRAs
are
currently
available
as
commercial
kits.
Systematic
reviews
have
reported
strong
evidence
that
IGRAs
have
high
specificity
that
is
unaffected
by
bacille
Calmette-
Guérin
(BCG)
vaccination41,
42.
TST,
in
contrast,
has
high
specificity
in
populations
who
have
not
been
vaccinated
with
BCG
but
specificity
is
modest
and
inconsistent
in
populations
vaccinated
with
BCG.
The
high
specificity
of
IGRAs
is
proving
to
be
useful
in
individuals
vaccinated
with
BCG43.
IGRAs
may
be
excellent
options
in
these
populations
and
it
seems
to
be
at
least
as
sensitive
as
TST42.
Both
these
immune-based
tests
merely
indicate
a
cellular
immune
response
to
recent
or
remote
sensitization
with
MTB.
IFN-γ
can
be
easily
induced
in
peripheral
blood
monocytes
or
whole
blood
through
antigenic
stimulation
in
sufficient
quantities
that
it
can
be
detected
using
simple
technologies,
such
as
ELISA.
IGRA
tests
rely
on
detecting
elevated
IFN-γ
production
after
stimulation
with
antigens
(ESAT-6,
CFP10).
Because
these
antigens
are
largely
restricted
to
members
of
the
MTB
complex,
the
tests
are
not
confounded
by
BCG
or
environmental
mycobacteria.
Because
IGRAs
cannot
distinguish
between
latent
and
active
TB,
a
positive
IGRA
result
may
not
necessarily
indicate
active
TB.
A
negative
IGRA
result
would
not
conclusively
rule
out
active
disease
in
an
individual
suspected
to
have
TB
(similar
to
the
results
of
a
TST).
About
50%
of
patients
with
culture-confirmed
TBM
had
no
detectable
MTB

interferon-gamma

lymphocytes
in
peripheral
blood
at
presentation40.The
use
of
IGRAs
is
steadily
increasing
in
countries
with
low
or
intermediate
incidence.
Despite
the
large
number
of
publications
on
IGRAs,
evidence
is
still
limited
on
the
prognostic
value
of
these
tests,
and
their
added
value
in
TB
diagnosis44.
There
is
growing
evidence
that
the
performance
of
IGRAs
varies
between
countries
with
high
and
low
incidence
of
TB45.
Their
role,
if
any,
seems
to
be
limited
in
low
income
countries
with
a
high
TB
burden.ADAADA
is
associated
largely
with
lymphocytic
proliferation
and
differentiation
and
is
considered
to
be
a
marker
of
cell-mediated
immunity46.
The
measured
sensitivities
and
specificities
of
ADA
in
the
CSF
range
from
44
to
100%
and
71
to
100%,
respectively47.
In
one
study,
ADA
was
not
valuable
in
distinguishing
TBM
in
patients
with
HIV
infection.48
Standardized
cutoffs
of
ADA
values
for
the
diagnosis
of
TBM
have
not
been
established,
and
the
values
used
in
various
studies
ranged
from
>5.0
to
>15
IU/liter.
CSF
ADA
measurements
have
been
found
to
be
useful
in
predicting
poor
neurological
outcomes
among
pediatric
TBM
cases49.
Raised
ADA
activity
in
the
CSF
of
patients
with
CNS
TB
lacks
specificity.
High
CSF
ADA
activity
has
been
reported
from
patients
with
lymphomas,
malaria,
brucellosis,
pyogenic
meningitis,
cryptococcal
meningitis,
and

acidTuberculostearic
acid
is

fatty
acid
component
of
the
M.
tuberculosis
cell
wall52.
Although
its
estimation
has
good
sensitivity
and
specificity
in
limited
studies,
the
requirement
for
expensive
equipment
has
limited
its
clinical
use.Radiological
EvaluationEvery
patient
with
TBM
should
preferably
be
evaluated
with
contrast
enhanced
CT
imaging
before
the
start
or
within
the
first
48
hours
of
treatment35.
Early
brain
CT
can
help
diagnose
TBM,
and
will
provide
important
baseline
information
regarding
surgical
interventions
for
hydrocephalus.
Choroid
plexus
enhancement
with
ventricular
enlargement
on
imaging
is
highly
suggestive
of
TBM.
In
TBM,
MRI
shows
diffuse,
thick,
meningeal
enhancement.
Cerebral
infarcts
can
be
seen
in
nearly
30%
of
cases53.
A
study
from
South
Africa
reported
that
the
combination
of
hydrocephalus,
basal
enhancement
and
infarction
was
100%
specific
and
41%
sensitive
for
the
diagnosis
of
childhood
TBM,
although
the
authors
suggested
pre-contrast
hyperdensity
in
the
basal
cisterns
as
the
best
predictor
of
TBM54.Contrast
enhanced
MRI
is
generally
considered
as
the
modality
of
choice.
It
is
useful
for
assessment
of
the
location
of
lesions
and
their
margins,
as
well
as
ventriculitis,
meningitis
and
spinal
involvement
(sensitivity

vasculopathy
TCD
reveals

and,
accordingly,
by

of
CNS
TBThe
first
combination
therapy
for
TB
consisted
of
para-aminosalicylic
acid
(PAS)
and
isoniazid
(H)
in
addition
to
streptomycin,
given
for
24
months,
and
it
became
the
basis
for
treatment
of
TB
in
the
developed
world
for
about
a
decade.
In
the
mid
1960s,
PAS
was
replaced
by
ethambutol
(E),
a
better-tolerated
drug,
and
the
treatment
duration
was
reduced
from
24
to
18
months.
In
the
late
1960s
rifampicin-containing
regimen
including
isoniazid,
ethambutol,
and
streptomycin
offered
a
predictable
cure
in
more
than
95%
of
patients
with
9-
to
12-month
duration
of
therapy.
In
the
early
1980s
addition
of
pyrazinamide
(Z)
in
the
intensive
phase
of
treatment,
decreased
the
duration
of
a
fully
orally
administered
treatment
to
6
to
8
months.
Studies
conducted
in
East
Africa
showed
that
the
relapse
rate
after
a
6-month
regimen
was
reduced
from
22%
to
8%
by
the
addition
of
pyrazinamide,
and
to
3%
by
the
addition
of
rifampicin58.Since

to
8-month
regimen,

to
at

12
months
in

Isoniazid
penetrates
the
CSF
freely61
and
has
potent
early
bactericidal
activity.
At
standard
doses
isoniazid
achieves
CSF
levels
10–15
times
the
minimum
inhibitory
concentration
of
M.
tuberculosis62.
The
main
disadvantage
of
INH
is
that
resistance
develops
quite
quickly
when
used
as
monotherapy
though
this
does
not
seem
to
happen
when
it
is
used
to
eradicate
the
organism
in
a
patient
who
has
become
infected
but
has
not
yet
developed
overt
signs
or
symptoms
of
infection
(chemoprophylaxis).
Pyridoxine
is
extremely
effective
in
stopping
the
seizures,
reversing
the
coma,
and
correcting
the
metabolic
acidosis
triggered
by
any
acute
overdose
of
isoniazid.
Treatment
is
best
given
as
a
relatively
rapid
intravenous
(IV)
infusion,
the
standard
dose
being
one
mg
of
pyridoxine
for
every
mg
of
isoniazid
the
patient
is
thought
to
have
taken63.
Crushed
tablets
can
be
given
down
a
nasogastric
tube
if
no
IV
preparation
is
readily
available.
Prompt
treatment
is
called
for
because
INH
dose
in
excess
of
90
mg/kg
is
extremely
likely
to
trigger
recurrent
seizure
activity,
which
can
be
fatal64.
Rifampicin
penetrates
the
CSF
less
well
(maximum
concentrations
around
30%
of
plasma),
but
the
high
mortality
from
rifampicin
resistant
TBM
has
confirmed
its
key
role
in
the
treatment
of
CNS
disease65.
The
incidence
of
ethambutol
induced
optic
neuritis
is
less
than
3%
at
the
standard
dose
of
15–20
mg/kg
though
it
is
a
concern,
especially
when
treating
comatose
patients66.
Fluoroquinolones
are
an
effective
fourth
agent
(if
ethambutol
is
contraindicated),
but
should
be
avoided
in
women
who
are
pregnant
or
breastfeeding
and
prolonged
fluoroquinolone
therapy
is
not
advised
for
children67.
Interruptions
in
treatment
are
an
independent
risk
factor
for
death
from
TBM68.Rationale
use
of
steroids
in
CNS
TBAll
patients
with
TBM
may
receive
adjunctive
corticosteroids
regardless
of
disease
severity
at
presentation.
Adults
(>14
years)
should
start
treatment
with
dexamethasone
0.4
mg/kg/24
hours
with
a
tapering
course
over
6
to
8
weeks.
Children
(d″14
years)
should
be
given
prednisolone
4mg/kg/24
hrs
(or
equivalent
dose
dexamethasone:
0.6
mg/kg/24
hrs)
for
4
weeks,
followed
by
a
tapering
course
over
4
weeks69.
The
role
of
routine
adjunctive
corticosteroids
for
all
patients
with
tuberculomas
without
meningitis,
or
with
spinal
cord
tuberculosis
is
arguable
albeit
corticosteroids
may
be
helpful
in
those
patients
whose
symptoms
are
not
controlled,
or
are
worsening,
on
anti-tuberculosis
therapy.
Doses
similar
to
those
used
for
TBM
should
be
given.
Thalidomide
may
be
helpful
in
patients
with
tuberculomas
that
are
not
responding
to
antituberculosis
drugs
and
high
dose
corticosteroids70.Management
of
CNS
TB
in
HIV
infectedCNS
tuberculosis
in
HIV
infected
patients
should
be
managed
with
the
same
anti-tuberculosis
drug
regimen
as
that
recommended
for
HIV
uninfected
individuals;
whenever
possible
the
regimen
should
include
rifampicin.
Adjunctive
corticosteroids
are
recommended
for
those
with
TBM
and
HIV
infection.
Starting
anti-retroviral
therapy
depends
upon
balancing
the
risks
of
drug
interactions
and
Immune
Reconstitution
Inflammatory
Syndrome
(IRIS)
when
started
early
and
opportunistic
diseases
if
delayed.
If
CD4
>
200
cells/µl
it
is
better
to
defer
HIV
treatment
as
long
as
possible,
ideally
until
end
of
tuberculosis
treatment35.
Start
anti-retroviral
treatment
(ART)
if
the
CD4
count
falls
below
200
cells/ìl
during
tuberculosis
treatment.
If
CD4
is
100–200
cells/ìL
start
ART
after
approximately
2
months
of
anti-tuberculosis
treatment
so
that
risk
of
IRIS
is
minimised.
If
CD4
is
<
100
cells/ìL
start
ART
within
the
first
2
weeks
of
anti-tuberculosis
treatment.
Rifampicin
will
induce
the
metabolism
of
protease
inhibitors,
delavirdine
and
nevirapine
reducing
the
level
of
these
drugs.
When
possible,
treat
with
rifampicin
and
a
non-nucleoside
reverse
transcriptase
inhibitor
(NNRTI),
preferably
efavirenz
but
the
dose
of
efavirenz
should
be
increased
to
800mg.
Rifabutin
should
be
used
if
treatment
with
a
protease
inhibitor
(PI)
is
required,
but
at
a
reduced
dose
(usually
150mg
3
times
per
week).
If
efavirenz
and
rifabutin
are
co-administered,
a
450
mg
daily
dosage
of
rifabutin
is
recommended.Management
of
common
treatment
complications,
including
drug-induced
hepatitisNew
or
worsening
neurological
signs
in
patients
on
treatment
for
CNS
tuberculosis
should
prompt
immediate
imaging.
Hyponatraemia
should
be
considered
as
a
cause
of
coma
and
seizures.
Slow
correction
of
sodium
either
by
sodium
and
water
replacement
if
the
patient
is
hypovolaemic,
or
by
fluid
restriction
if
they

is
advised
to
prevent
risk
of
myelinolysis.If
drug-induced

occurs,
and
if
serum
transaminases
rise
above
five
times
normal
stopping
pyrazinamide,
continuing
isoniazid,
rifampicin,
ethambutol,
and
performing
daily
liver

tests
is
recommended35.
If
serum
albumin
falls,
the
prothrombin
time
rises,
or
the
transaminases
continue
to
rise,
isoniazid
and
rifampicin
should
be
withdrawn.
Streptomycin
and
ethambutol
should
be
given,
along
with
moxifloxacin
or
levofloxacin.
Rifampicin
and
isoniazid
should
be
restarted
once

in
a
separate
windowIn
a
recent
study
175
patients
with
a
diagnosis
of
antituberculosis
drug-induced
hepatotoxicity
(DIH)
were
randomized
to
receive
1
of
3
different
predefined
reintroduction
regimens
in
which
one
group
were
given
isoniazid,
rifampicin,
and
pyrazinamide
simultaneously
at
full
dosage
from
day
1
while
the
other
received
antituberculosis
drugs
in
a
manner
similar
to
that
recommended
in
the
American
Thoracic
Society
guidelines
for
reintroduction
and
the
third
were
administered
drugs
accordance
with
British
Thoracic
Society
guidelines71.
19
patients
(10.9%)
had
recurrence
of
DIH
during
follow-up
and
the
recurrence
rate
was
not
significantly
different
between
the
3
groups.
Pretreatment
serum
albumin
level
was
the
only
statistically
significant
predictor
of
future
recurrence
of
DIH
on
reintroduction
of
antituberculosis
drugs.
Patients
with
life-threatening
tuberculosis
can
be
reintroduced
simultaneously
at
full
dosage
safely
from
day
1
with
all
3
of
the
potentially
hepatotoxic
drugs
(isoniazid,
rifampicin,
and
pyrazinamide).Role
of
neurosurgeryHydrocephalus,
tuberculous
brain
abscess
(TBA),
and
vertebral
tuberculosis
with
cord
compression
are
all
indications
for
urgent
neurosurgical
referral
though
early
hydrocephalus
and
tuberculous
brain
abscess
can
be
successfully
treated
by
drugs
alone
.
So
early
recognition
and
timely
treatment
is
critical
in
avoiding
the
surgery.
TBA
occurs
in
only
4%
to
8%
of
patients
with
CNS
TB
who
do
not
have
HIV
infection
but
in
20%
of
patients
who
do
have
HIV
infection.
The
aim
of
surgical
management
of
TBA
is
to
reduce
the
size
of
the
space-occupying
lesion
and
thereby
diminish
intracranial
pressure
and
to
eradicate
the
pathogen.
Early
surgical
drainage
and
chemotherapy
are
considered
the
most
appropriate
treatment
for
TBA
and
can
be
therapeutic
as
well
as
diagnostic.
It
should
be
carefully
planned
and
individualized
according
to
the
patient's
clinical
condition,
anatomic
localization,
and
the
number
of
lesions.
Early
anti
tuberculous
therapy
(ATT)
must
be
considered
in
all
cases
of
suspected
TBA
even
before
surgery,
in
order
to
reduce
the
risk
of
postoperative
meningitis.
An
open
surgical
excision
is
an
appropriate
treatment
option
for
large,
multiloculated
cerebellar
lesions
that
cause
brain
herniation
and
also
in
those
that
do
not
respond
to
aspiration
while
stereotactic-guided
aspiration
is
preferred
in
eloquent
or
deep-seated
areas
such
as
the
hypothalamus,
thalamus,
or
deep
temporal
regions
in
order
to
prevent
severe
neurological
sequelae.
The
main
disadvantage
of
the
latter
option
is
the
need
for
repeated
procedures
in
as
many
as
70%
of
patients,
and
the
high
risk
of
rupture
into
ventricles
or
the
subarachnoid
space,
which
could
lead
to
ventricular
ependymitis
or
meningitis
and
worsening
of
neurological
deficits.
An
early
surgical
procedure
can
improve
the
efficacy
of
ATT,
promote
a
better
clinical
response
after
reduction
of
bacillary
load
and
reduce
mortality72.
Hydrocephalus,
either
communicating(more
common)
or
obstructive,
is
one
of
the
commonest
complications
of
TBM
occurring
in
up
to
85%
of
children
with
the
disease
in
whom
it
is
more
severe
than
in
adults.
Patients
with
TBM
and
hydrocephalus
who
have
a
Glascow
coma
scale
(GCS)
of
15
(with
or
without
focal
neurological
deficit)
could
be
tried
for
a
few
days
or
a
week
on
diuretics
and
steroids
with
close
monitoring
to
detect
any
worsening
or
lack
of
improvement
and
a
shunt
should
promptly
be
offered
in
case
of
failure
of
medical
management.
Ventriculoperitoneal
shunt
is
the
procedure
of
choice
if
the
duration
of
illness
is
<4
weeks
while
endoscopic
third
ventriculostomy
or
ventriculoperitoneal
shunt
can
be
offered
if
duration
>4weeks.
Patients
with
GCS
>8
and
<14
are
better
off
with
an
early
shunt
procedure
and
so
are
those
with
GCS
>3
and
<8
who
improve
within
48
hours
after
an
external
ventricular
drainage
(EDV)
while
those
with
GCS
>3
and
<8
who
fail
the
EDV
trial
are
unlikely
to
benefit
with
shunt
and
are
managed
conservatively73.
Urgent
surgical
decompression
should
be
considered
in
all
those
with
extradural
lesions
causing
paraparesis74.Prognosis
and
sequelaeThe
single
most
important
determinant
of
outcome,
for
both
survival
and
sequelae,
is
the
stage
of
tuberculous
meningitis
at
which
treatment
has
been
started
others
being
extremes
of
age,
malnutrition,
hydrocephalus,
focal
neurological
deficit
,presence
of

disease
,
underlying
debilitating
disease
and
alcoholism.
If
treatment
is
started
in
stage
I,
mortality
and
morbidity
is
very
low,
while
in
stage
III
almost
50%
of
patients
die,
and
those
who
recover
may
have
some
form
of
neurological
deficit75.
Survivors
manifest
a
variety
of
neurological
sequelae.
Intracranial
calcification
develops
in
20%
to
48%
of
patients
with
tuberculous
meningitis,
usually
becoming
detectable
2
to
3
years
after
the
onset
of
the
disease76.Go
to:ConclusionEarly
recognition
and
timely
treatment
of
CNS
TB
is
critical
if
the
considerable
mortality
and
morbidity
associated
with
the
condition
is
to
be
prevented.
A

OverviewTuberculosis
(TB)
is
a
potentially
serious
infectious
disease
that
mainly
affects
the
lungs.
The
bacteria
that
cause
tuberculosis
are
spread
from
person
to
person
through
tiny
droplets
released
into
the
air
via
coughs
and
sneezes.
Once
rare
in
developed
countries,
tuberculosis
infections
began
increasing
in
1985,
partly
because
of
the
emergence
of
HIV,
the
virus
that
causes
AIDS.
HIV
weakens
a
person's
immune
system,
so
it
can't
fight
the
TB
germs.
In
the
United
States,
because
of
stronger
control
programs,
tuberculosis
began
to
decrease
again
in
1993.
But
it
remains
a
concern.
Many
tuberculosis
strains
resist
the
drugs
most
used
to
treat
the
disease.
People
with
active
tuberculosis
must
take
many
types
of
medications
for
months
to
get
rid
of
the
infection
and
prevent
antibiotic
resistance.Products

SymptomsAlthough
your
body
can
harbor
the
bacteria
that
cause
tuberculosis,
your
immune
system
usually
can
prevent
you
from
becoming
sick.
For
this
reason,
doctors
make
a
distinction
between:
Latent
TB.
You
have
a
TB
infection,
but
the
bacteria
in
your
body
are
inactive
and
cause
no
symptoms.
Latent
TB,
also
called
inactive
TB
or
TB
infection,
isn't
contagious.
Latent
TB
can
turn
into
active
TB,
so
treatment
is
important.
Active
TB.
Also
called
TB
disease,
this
condition
makes
you
sick
and,
in
most
cases,
can
spread
to
others.
It
can
occur
weeks
or
years
after
infection
with
the
TB
bacteria.
Signs
and
symptoms
of
active
TB
include:
Coughing
for
three
or
more
weeks
Coughing
up
blood
or
mucus
Chest
pain,
or
pain
with
breathing
or
coughing
Unintentional
weight
loss
Fatigue
Fever
Night
sweats
Chills
Loss
of
appetite
Tuberculosis
can
also
affect
other
parts
of
your
body,
including
the
kidneys,
spine
or
brain.
When
TB
occurs
outside
your
lungs,
signs
and
symptoms
vary
according
to
the
organs
involved.
For
example,
tuberculosis
of
the
spine
might
cause
back
pain,
and
tuberculosis
in
your
kidneys
might
cause
blood
in
your
urine.
When
to
see
a
doctorSee
your
doctor
if
you
have
a
fever,
unexplained
weight
loss,
drenching
night
sweats
or
a
persistent
cough.
These
are
often
indications
of
TB
but
can
also
result
from
other
conditions.
Also,
see
your
doctor
if
you
think
you've
been
exposed
to
TB.
The
Centers
for
Disease
Control
and
Prevention
recommends
that
people
who
have
an
increased
risk
of
tuberculosis
be
screened
for
latent
TB
infection.
This
recommendation
includes
people
who:
Have
HIV/AIDS
Use
IV
drugs
Are
in
contact
with
infected
people
Are
from
a
country
where
TB
is
common,
such
as
several
countries
in
Latin
America,
Africa
and
Asia
Live
or
work
in
areas
where
TB
is
common,
such
as
prisons
or
nursing
homes
Work
in
health
care
and
treat
people
with
a
high
risk
of
TB
Are
children
who
are
exposed
to
adults
at
risk
of
TB

CausesTuberculosis
is
caused
by
bacteria
that
spread
from
person
to
person
through
microscopic
droplets
released
into
the
air.
This
can
happen
when
someone
with
the
untreated,
active
form
of
tuberculosis
coughs,
speaks,
sneezes,
spits,
laughs
or
sings.
Although
tuberculosis
is
contagious,
it's
not
easy
to
catch.
You're
much
more
likely
to
get
tuberculosis
from
someone
you
live
or
work
with
than
from
a
stranger.
Most
people
with
active
TB
who've
had
appropriate
drug
treatment
for
at
least
two
weeks
are
no
longer
contagious.
HIV
and
TBSince
the
1980s,
tuberculosis
cases
have
increased
dramatically
because
of
the
spread
of
HIV,
the
virus
that
causes
AIDS.
HIV
suppresses
the
immune
system,
making
it
difficult
for
the
body
to
control
TB
bacteria.
As
a
result,
people
with
HIV
are
much
more
likely
to
get
TB
and
to
progress
from
latent
to
active
disease
than
are
people
who
aren't
HIV
positive.
Drug-resistant
TBTuberculosis
also
remains
a
major
killer
because
of
the
increase
in
drug-resistant
strains.
Over
time,
some
TB
germs
have
developed
the
ability
to
survive
despite
medications.
This
is
partly
because
people
don't
take
their
drugs
as
directed
or
don't
complete
the
course
of
treatment.
Drug-resistant
strains
of
tuberculosis
emerge
when
an
antibiotic
fails
to
kill
all
of
the
bacteria
it
targets.
The
surviving
bacteria
become
resistant
to
that
drug
and
often
other
antibiotics
as
well.
Some
TB
bacteria
have
developed
resistance
to
the
most
commonly
used
treatments,
such
as
isoniazid
and
rifampin
(Rifadin,
Rimactane).
Some
TB
strains
have
also
developed
resistance
to
drugs
less
commonly
used
in
TB
treatment,
such
as
the
antibiotics
known
as
fluoroquinolones,
and
injectable
medications
including
amikacin
and
capreomycin
(Capastat).
These
medications
are
often
used
to
treat
infections
that
are
resistant
to
the
more
commonly
used
drugs.
Risk
factorsAnyone
can
get
tuberculosis,
but
certain
factors
can
increase
your
risk,
including:
Weakened
immune
systemA
healthy
immune
system
often
successfully
fights
TB
bacteria.
However,
several
conditions
and
medications
can
weaken
your
immune
system,
including:
HIV/AIDS
Diabetes
Severe
kidney
disease
Certain
cancers
Cancer
treatment,
such
as
chemotherapy
Drugs
to
prevent
rejection
of
transplanted
organs
Some
drugs
used
to
treat
rheumatoid
arthritis,
Crohn's
disease
and
psoriasis
Malnutrition
or
low
body
weight
Very
young
or
advanced
age
Traveling
or
living
in
certain
areasYour
risk
of
getting
tuberculosis
is
higher
if
you
live
in,
emigrate
from
or
travel
to
areas
with
high
tuberculosis
rates.
Areas
include:
Africa
Asia
Eastern
Europe
Russia
Latin
America
Other
factors
Using
substances.
IV
drugs
or
excessive
alcohol
use
weakens
your
immune
system
and
makes
you
more
vulnerable
to
tuberculosis.
Using
tobacco.
Tobacco
use
greatly
increases
the
risk
of
getting
TB
and
dying
of
it.
Working
in
health
care.
Regular
contact
with
people
who
are
ill
increases
your
chances
of
exposure
to
TB
bacteria.
Wearing
a
mask
and
frequent
hand-washing
greatly
reduce
your
risk.
Living
or
working
in
a
residential
care
facility.
People
who
live
or
work
in
prisons,
homeless
shelters,
psychiatric
hospitals
or
nursing
homes
are
all
at
a
higher
risk
of
tuberculosis
due
to
overcrowding
and
poor
ventilation.
Living
with
someone
infected
with
TB.
Close
contact
with
someone
who
has
TB
increases
your
risk.
ComplicationsWithout
treatment,
tuberculosis
can
be
fatal.
Untreated
active
disease
typically
affects
your
lungs,
but
it
can
affect
other
parts
of
your
body,
as
well.
Tuberculosis
complications
include:
Spinal
pain.
Back
pain
and
stiffness
are
common
complications
of
tuberculosis.
Joint
damage.
Arthritis
that
results
from
tuberculosis
(tuberculous
arthritis)
usually
affects
the
hips
and
knees.
Swelling
of
the
membranes
that
cover
your
brain
(meningitis).
This
can
cause
a
lasting
or
intermittent
headache
that
occurs
for
weeks
and
possible
mental
changes.
Liver
or
kidney
problems.
Your
liver
and
kidneys
help
filter
waste
and
impurities
from
your
bloodstream.
Tuberculosis
in
these
organs
can
impair
their
functions.
Heart
disorders.
Rarely,
tuberculosis
can
infect
the
tissues
that
surround
your
heart,
causing
inflammation
and
fluid
collections
that
might
interfere
with
your
heart's
ability
to
pump
effectively.
This
condition,
called
cardiac
tamponade,
can
be
fatal.
PreventionIf
you
test
positive
for
latent
TB
infection,
your
doctor
might
advise
you
to
take
medications
to
reduce
your
risk
of
developing
active
tuberculosis.
Only
active
TB
is
contagious.
Protect
your
family
and
friendsIf
you
have
active
TB,
it
generally
takes
a
few
weeks
of
treatment
with
TB
medications
before
you're
not
contagious
anymore.
Follow
these
tips
to
help
keep
your
friends
and
family
from
getting
sick:
Stay
home.
Don't
go
to
work
or
school
or
sleep
in
a
room
with
other
people
during
the
first
few
weeks
of
treatment.
Ventilate
the
room.
Tuberculosis
germs
spread
more
easily
in
small
closed
spaces
where
air
doesn't
move.
If
it's
not
too
cold
outdoors,
open
the
windows
and
use
a
fan
to
blow
indoor
air
outside.
Cover
your
mouth.
Use
a
tissue
to
cover
your
mouth
anytime
you
laugh,
sneeze
or
cough.
Put
the
dirty
tissue
in
a
bag,
seal
it
and
throw
it
away.
Wear
a
face
mask.
Wearing
a
face
mask
when
you're
around
other
people
during
the
first
three
weeks
of
treatment
may
help
lessen
the
risk
of
transmission.
Finish
your
medicationThis
is
the
most
important
step
you
can
take
to
protect
yourself
and
others
from
tuberculosis.
When
you
stop
treatment
early
or
skip
doses,
TB
bacteria
have
a
chance
to
develop
mutations
that
allow
them
to
survive
the
most
potent
TB
drugs.
The
resulting
drug-resistant
strains
are
deadlier
and
more
difficult
to
treat.
VaccinationsIn
countries
where
tuberculosis
is
more
common,
infants
often
are
vaccinated
with
bacille
Calmette-Guerin
(BCG)
vaccine.
The
BCG
vaccine
isn't
recommended
for
general
use
in
the
United
States
because
it
isn't
very
effective
in
adults.
Dozens
of
new
TB
vaccines
are
in
various
stages
of
development
and
testing.

Tuberculosis
is
a
severe
infectious
disease
that
usually
affects
your
lungs.
When
it
spreads
to
your
bones,
it's
known
as
skeletal
tuberculosis.Tuberculosis
is
an
airborne
disease
caused
by
a
very
infectious
bacterium
called
Mycobacterium
tuberculosis.
It
can
travel
through
the
blood
to
the
lymph
nodes
and
bones
as
well
as
the
spine
and
joint.Tuberculosis
and
Its
Types‌Tuberculosis
is
a
contagious
disease,
which
means
it
can
spread
from
one
person
to
another.
It's
more
common
in
developing
countries,
but
about
7,163
cases
were
reported
in
the
U.S.
in
2020.Tuberculosis
can
be
deadly.
In
many
developing
nations,
children
get
the
Bacille
Calmette-Guerin
or
BCG
vaccine
at
birth
to
prevent
tuberculosis.There
are
two
main
types
of
tuberculosis
infections:Pulmonary
tuberculosis,
which
mainly
involves
your
lungs.
The
infection
can
cause
chest
pain,
trouble
breathing,
and
lung
problems. Extrapulmonary
tuberculosis,
when
tuberculosis
affects
areas
of
the
body
other
than
your
lungs.
This
is
more
often
seen
in
people
who
have
weakened
immune
systems
because
of
HIV/AIDS.
Extrapulmonary
tuberculosis
that
affects
your
bones,
spine,
or
joints
is
called
bone
or
skeletal
tuberculosis. Bone
Tuberculosis‌Bone
tuberculosis
affects
your
skeletal
system,
which
consists
of
bones
and
joints.
The
most
common
type
is
spinal
tuberculosis.
This
happens
when
the
mycobacterium
infection
spreads
into
your
spinal
cord.
Spinal
tuberculosis
is
also
called
Pott’s
disease. ‌This
type
of
tuberculosis
is
more
common
in
underdeveloped
countries.
It
accounts
for
2.2%
to
4.7%
of
the
total
tuberculosis
cases
in
Europe
and
the
U.S. Causes
of
Bone
Tuberculosis‌Skeletal
tuberculosis
is
also
caused
by
Mycobacterium
tuberculosis.
Unlike
pulmonary
tuberculosis,
studies
have
shown
that
bone
or
spinal
tuberculosis
may
not
spread
through
the
air.
The
infection
can
spread
through
your
blood
if
you
come
in
contact
with
an
infected
person’s
body
fluids
or
pus. Skeletal
tuberculosis
can
also
be
caused
by
pulmonary
tuberculosis.
Mycobacteria
can
easily
spread
from
your
lungs
to
your
bones,
spine,
or
joints
through
blood
vessels.
This
can
affect
your
long
bones
or
spinal
vertebrae.This
type
of
tuberculosis
is
rare
and
is
typically
seen
most
often
in
places
with
widespread
AIDS
infections.
Bone
tuberculosis
affects
people
with
AIDS
because
their
immune
system
is
weakened
by
the
virus. Symptoms
of
Bone
Tuberculosis‌Often,
you
may
have
tuberculosis
but
not
notice
symptoms.
Bone
tuberculosis
is
very
hard
to
diagnose
because
symptoms
don’t
show
up
until
the
infection
is
severe
or
advanced.
They
may
include:Severe
back
pain‌Inflammation
in
back
or
joints‌Stiffness Trouble
moving
or
walking,
especially
in
children‌Spinal
abscess ‌Soft
tissue
swelling‌Neurological
disorders‌Tuberculosis-related
meningitis‌Muscle
weakness Paralysis
from
the
waist
down
(paraplegia)
or
of
all
four
limbs
and
sometimes
in
specific
organs
(tetraplegia)‌Kyphosis,
also
known
as
hunchback‌Bone
or
spinal
deformitiesDiagnosis
of
Bone
TuberculosisCommon
methods
for
diagnosing
bone
tuberculosis
include:Bacterial
culture.
If
you
have
bone
tuberculosis,
you
probably
have
an
underlying
lung
infection.
Your
doctor
may
take
a
blood
or
sputum
sample
and
test
it
for
Mycobacterium
tuberculosis. Biopsy.
Your
doctor
may
order
a
biopsy,
which
involves
taking
part
of
infected
tissue
and
checking
it
for
infection. Body
fluid
test.
Your
doctor
may
draw
pleural
fluid,
which
surrounds
and
protects
your
lungs,
to
check
for
infection.
Or
they
may
take
cerebrospinal
fluid
from
around
your
spinal
cord.
For
bone
or
joint
tuberculosis,
your
doctor
may
draw
synovial
or
joint
fluid
for
testing.
Polymerase
chain
reaction
(PCR)
test.
The
samples
that
your
doctor
takes
can
also
be
tested
using
PCR.
This
test
boosts
the
genetic
material
of
the
mycobacterium
and
helps
look
for
infection
from
small
amounts
of
fluids.‌Immunological
tests.
Your
doctor
can
use
your
blood
or
body
fluid
sample
to
check
for
antibodies
against
tuberculosis
or,
in
some
cases,
AIDS.Radiological
tests.
If
you
have
symptoms
like
bone
deformities,
you
may
need
an
X-ray,
CT
scan,
or
MRI. Treatment
of
Bone
TuberculosisWithout
treatment,
bone
tuberculosis
can
be
deadly.
Treatments
to
reverse
the
damage
of
bone
tuberculosis
include:‌Anti-tuberculosis
drugs.
Rifampicin,
streptomycin,
kanamycin,
isoniazid,
protionamide,
cycloserine,
and
pyrazinamide
are
the
most
common
anti-tuberculosis
drugs.
They
can
penetrate
the
cerebrospinal
fluid
and
attack
the
bacteria.
It
may
take
6
to
12
months
to
cure
bone
tuberculosis.‌Corticosteroids.
These
medications
may
be
prescribed
to
prevent
complications
such
as
inflammation
around
your
spinal
cord
or
heart.‌Surgery.
If
you
have
advanced
bone
tuberculosis,
you
may
need
surgery
to
remove
an
infected
part.

Answer
Symptoms
of
genitourinary
TB
may
include
flank
pain,
dysuria,
and
frequent
urination.
In
men,
genital
TB
may
manifest
as
a
painful
scrotal
mass,
prostatitis,
orchitis,
or
epididymitis.
In
women,
genital
TB
may
mimic
pelvic
inflammatory
disease.
TB
is
the
cause
of
approximately
10%
of
sterility
cases
in
women
worldwide
and
of
approximately
1%
in
industrialized
countries.

Lymphadenitis
(Scrofula):
Peripheral
NodesLymphadenitis
is
the
most
frequent
form
of
extrapulmonary
TB.
In
HIV-negative
persons,
it
is
usually
unilateral
and
cervical
in
location.462
The
most
common
site
is
along
the
upper
border
of
the
sternocleidomastoid
muscle,
where
it
presents
as
a
painless,
red,
firm
mass.
It
is
seen
most
frequently
in
young
adult
females
of
non-European
ancestry,
although
it
can
affect
any
age
or
race.
Children
often
have
an
ongoing
primary
infection,
but
in
other
age
groups
evidence
of
extranodal
TB
and
systemic
symptoms
are
usually
absent.
Lymphadenopathy
outside
the
cervical
and
supraclavicular
area
indicates
more
serious
TB,
usually
with
systemic
symptoms.
The
TST
result
is
almost
always
positive.
Fine-needle
aspiration
demonstrates
cytologic
evidence
of
granuloma,
but
smears
or
cultures
are
usually
negative.463
Biopsy
with
culture
is
often
required
for
diagnosis,
because
nodes
with
a
nonspecific
histologic
appearance
have
been
positive
forM.
tuberculosis
on
culture,
and
material
with
typical
histologic
features
may
be
due
to
other
mycobacteria
or
fungi.
Complete
excision
of
involved
nodes
with
no
drain
left
in
place
is
recommended
in
order
to
diminish
the
possibility
of
postoperative
fistula
formation.
Untoward
events
such
as
node
enlargement
with
pain,
suppuration,
sinus
formation,
and
appearance
of
new
nodes
occur
in
25%
to
30%
of
cases,
both
during
and
after
chemotherapy,
and
do
not
indicate
failure
of
drug
treatment.
These
likely
represent
reactions
to
retained
tuberculous
antigens
rather
than
uncontrolled
infection;
they
usually
subside
spontaneously,
and
short
courses
of
corticosteroids
may
be
beneficial
when
the
problem
persists.464Conversely,
in
individuals
with
AIDS,
peripheral
tuberculous
lymphadenitis
is
almost
always
multifocal
and
associated
with
major
systemic
symptoms
such
as
fever,
weight
loss,
and
evidence
of
TB
in
the
lungs
(parenchyma,
nodes,
or
pleura)
or
elsewhere
(Fig.
249.10).463
In
an
early
series
from
New
York
City,
TB
caused
57%
of
generalized
lymphadenopathy
in
HIV-positive
injection
drug
users.465
In
contrast
to
non–HIV-infected
persons,
material
removed
with
fine-needle
aspiration
is
positive
on
acid-fast
stain
in
the
great
majority
of
cases—as
frequently
as
it
is
with
culture.
However,
both
cytologic
and
histologic
findings
are
less
specific
than
in
HIV-negative
persons.466View

ADENITISTuberculous
lymphadenitis,
or
scrofula,
is
almost
exclusively
caused
by
M.
tuberculosis
in
developed
countries
(Fig.
54-4).
Before
control
of
bovine
tuberculosis,
the
predominant
cause
of
tuberculous
adenitis
was
M.
bovis.
Occasional
cases
of
M.
bovis
are
observed
in
patients
from
underdeveloped
regions
in
which
consumption
of
contaminated
raw
milk
occurs.
Patients
proven
to
have
human
tuberculous
adenitis
often
report
previous
exposure
to
a
known
carrier
of
tuberculosis,48
but
most
patients
have
no
evidence
of
active
disease
on
a
chest
radiograph.44
Tuberculous
adenopathy
is
generally
associated
with
other
clinical
symptoms
and
signs,
including
a
strongly
positive
tuberculin
PPD
skin
test
and
hilar
adenopathy
or
apical
calcification
on
a
chest
radiograph.56
One
study
found
a
92%
sensitivity
when
two
of
three
of
the
following
criteria
were
fulfilled:
positive
PPD
skin
test,
abnormal
chest
radiograph,
or
contact
with
someone
with
known
infectious
tuberculosis.44
Tuberculous
adenitis
is
therefore
currently
considered
to
be
a
local
manifestation
of
a
systemic
disease
and
not
an
initial,
primary
focus
of
tuberculous
infection.5,10
Clinically,
patients
with
tuberculous
adenitis
are
usually
older
children
and
adolescents
who
present
with
nonsuppurative
lymphadenitis,31
which
may
be
bilateral.
A
retrospective
review
of
24
immunocompetent
children
with
tuberculous
lymphadenitis
showed
that
no
patient
had
bilateral
disease
and
the
submandibular
(29%)
and
the
anterior
cervical
(71%)
sites
were
the
only
areas
of
lymph
node
involvement.44
However,
posterior
triangle
nodal
involvement
does
occur.34The
diagnosis
of
tuberculous
adenitis
can
be
made
in
the
setting
of
an
appropriate
history,
suspicious
adenopathy
associated
with
a
strongly
positive
tuberculin
PPD
skin
test,
and
positive
acid-fast
bacteria
on
stain
or
culture
of
nodal
tissue.
Diagnostic
confirmation
may
be
aided
by
FNA
with
aspirate
culture
and
cytologic
examination.14,33
Rapid
diagnosis
of
tuberculous
adenitis
by
DNA
amplification
of
nodal
material
using
polymerase
chain
reaction
(PCR)
has
been
reported.42
In
contrast,
a
negative
tuberculin
PPD
test
essentially
excludes
the
diagnosis
of
tuberculous
adenitis.
If
a
diagnostic
dilemma
persists,
excisional
biopsy
in
the
operating
room
with
the
patient
under
general
anesthesia
is
warranted.
Incisional
biopsy
or
incision
and
drainage
should
be
avoided
to
prevent
development
of
chronic,
draining
sinus
tracts.5,51,56
Fistula
and
cheloid
formation
can
be
seen
in
up
to
100%
of
patients
who
underwent
incision
and
drainage
of
tuberculous
infected
lymph
nodes.44Tuberculous
adenitis
generally
responds
to
medical
management
that
consists
of
multiple-agent
chemotherapy.
If
tuberculous
infection
is
directly
observed,
the
World
Health
Organization
recommends
directly
observed
short-course
therapy,
which
includes
isoniazid,
rifampin,
and
pyrazinamide
for
the
first
2
months,
followed
by
isoniazid
and
rifampin
for
an
additional
4
months.60
Although
antituberculous
chemotherapy
remains
essential,
the
role
of
complete
surgical
excision
of
involved
nodes
is
more
controversial.6,12
Complete
excision
of
involved
nodes
is
prudent
when
biopsy
is
required
for
diagnosis;
when
a
chronic,
draining
sinus
tract
evolves
during
medical
treatment;
or
when
optimal
medical
management
fails.View

TuberculosisTuberculous
lymphadenitis
is
a

form
of
extrapulmonary

Cervical

is

but
inguinal,
axillary,
mesenteric,
mediastinal,
and
intramammary
involvement
have
also
been
described
(Golden

A

for

(Nahid
et al.,
2016;
Campbell,

However,
even
with

regimens,
the
rate
of
response
is
much
slower
than
with
pulmonary
tuberculosis.
Lymph

may
enlarge,
new

and

with

any
age

a
positive
history
of
exposure
to
an
infected
adult.
Tonsillar
and
submandibular
nodes
are
common
sites
of
TB
lymphadenitis,
because
lymphatic
extension
occurs
from
the
paratracheal
nodes.
Supraclavicular
nodes
are
affected
as
the
result
of
drainage
from
apical
pulmonary
lesions.
The
posterior
cervical
chain
is
another
common
area.Initially,
lymphoid
hyperplasia
develops
as
tubercles
form,
and
then
necrosis
and
caseation
dominate.
Early
on,
nodes
are
firm,
discrete,
and
nontender,
but
with
progression
they
tend
to
become
matted
and
adherent
to
the
overlying
skin,
which
often
becomes
discolored,
thickened,
and
scaly
(seeFig.
13.46A
to
C).
Without
treatment,
spontaneous
drainage
ultimately
occurs,
leaving
a
draining
sinus
(seeFig.
13.46D).Chest
radiographs
reveal
findings
suggestive
of
TB
in
75%
of
patients,
and
the
purified
protein
derivative
(PPD)
test
is
positive,
usually
with
more
than
15 mm
of
induration.
Interferon
gamma
release
assays
(IGRAs)
are
generally
positive
but
have
not
been
standardized
in
children
younger
than
5
years
old.

pharmacologic,

excision

those
in

Brande,
in
Tuberculosis,
2009Tuberculous
lymphadenopathyTuberculous
lymphadenopathy
is
the
most
common
manifestation
of
abdominal
TB.35
It
may
occur
as
an
isolated
manifestation
without
other
evidence
of
abdominal
involvement;
however,
associated
involvement
of
the
gastrointestinal
tract,
peritoneum
and
solid
viscera
(e.g.
liver
and
spleen)
is
often
seen.
Commonly
involved
lymph
node
groups
are
the
upper
para-aortic
region,
the
lesser
omentum,
the
mesentery
and
the
anterior
pararenal
space.35
This
preferential
distribution
is
explained
by
lymphatic
drainage
from
main
areas
of
infection:
small
bowel,
ileocaecum,
right
side
of
the
colon,
liver
and
spleen.
The
lower
para-aortic
lymph
nodes
may
be
involved
through
systemic
haematogenous
spread
or
from
direct
spread
from
the
reproductive
organs.17,26Tuberculous
lymphadenopathy
is
usually
multiple.
A
wide
spectrum
of
patterns
ranging
from
increased
number
of
normal-sized
nodes
to
massive
nodal
conglomerates
has
been
described.35,36
Tuberculous
lymphadenopathy
is
usually
not
responsible
for
invasion
or
obstruction
of
the
common
bile
duct,
blood
vessels
and
urinary
or
gastrointestinal
tracts.35,36The
CT
findings
of
abdominal
tuberculous
lymphadenopathy
include
circular
or
ovoid
lesions
showing
peripheral
enhancement
with
low-density
centre;
heterogeneous
or
homogeneous
enhancement
on
contrast-enhanced
CT
has
also
been
described.35
The
involved
lymph
nodes
may
occasionally
show
calcification.37On
MRI
tuberculous
lymphadenopathy
is
mostly
hyperintense
on
T2-weighted
images
(Fig.
26.11),
although
hypointense
lymphadenopathy
on
T2-weighted
images
has
been
reported.35,36
Similar
to
the
T2-weighted
appearance
of
an
intracranial
tuberculoma,
the
signal
intensity
may
differ,
depending
on
the
stage
of
evolution,
with
central
hyperintensity
on
T2-weighted
images
corresponding
to
liquefaction
necrosis,
and
central
hypointensity
resulting
from
the
presence
of
paramagnetic
free
radicals
secreted
from
active
phagocytic
cells.38
Obliteration
of
the
perinodal
fat,
characterized
by
increased
signal
intensities
on
T2-weighted
images,
has
been
suggested
to
reflect
capsular
disruption.35
On
T1-weighted
fat-suppressed
images,
lymphadenopathy
is
iso-
or
hypointense
and
shows
a
variety
of
patterns
of
enhancement,
even
within
the
same
nodal
group,
after
intravenous
administration
of
gadolinium.
This
finding
reflects
the
different
stages
of
the
pathological
process.35
Enhancement
patterns
include
peripheral
enhancement
visible
as
a
uniform,
thin
or
thick,
complete
or
incomplete
rim;
and
conglomerate
group
of
nodes
showing
peripheral
and
central
areas
of
enhancement.
Heterogeneous
enhancement
and,
less
frequently,
homogeneous
enhancement
or
no
enhancement
may
also
be
seen.35–38The
peripheral
enhancing
portion
has
been
proposed
to
correspond
to
a
perinodal
highly
vascular
inflammatory
response
or
granulation
tissue
within
the
nodes,
whereas
the
central
non-enhancing
portion
corresponds
to
caseation
or
liquefaction
necrosis
within
the
nodes.38
This
appearance,
especially
when
found
in
young
people,
is
highly
suggestive
but
not
pathognomonic
of
TB.
A
similar
pattern
may
also
be
seen
with
metastatic
malignancy,
lymphoma
after
treatment,
inflammatory
conditions,
such
as
Crohn's
disease,
pyogenic
infection
and
Whipple's
disease.27
In
untreated
lymphoma,
the
enhancement
pattern
of
lymphadenopathy
is
usually
homogeneous;
however,
after
treatment
the
enlarged
lymph
nodes
may
show
decreased
density
and
mesenteric
stranding.39
The
presence
of
calcification
within
enlarged
lymph
nodes
is
not
pathognomonic
of
TB
and
may
rarely
be
seen
in
metastases
from
teratomatous
testicular
tumours
and
non-Hodgkin's
lymphoma
after
treatment.39
However,
nodal
calcification
in
patients
from
endemic
areas
in
the
absence
of
known
primary
malignancy
suggests
a
tuberculous
aetiology.View

tuberculous
mycobacteria,
such
as
Mycobacterium
tuberculosis
or
M.
bovis.
Infection
by
M.
tuberculosis
is
a
serious
global
health
problem,
with
approximately
one
third
of
the
world's
population
harboring
M.
tuberculosis.
Approximately
9
×
106
new
cases
of
tuberculosis
and
approximately
2
×
106
deaths
from
tuberculosis
occur
each
year.
In
Central
Africa,
for
example,
tuberculous
lymphadenitis
is
the
most
common
finding
among
patients
who
undergo
a
superficial
lymph
node
biopsy;
nearly
all
of
these
African
patients
are
human
immunodeficiency
virus
positive
(HIV+).
M.
tuberculosis
was
also
the
most
common
specific
cause
of
cervical
lymphadenopathy
in
children
in
a
study
from
South
Africa.
Although
tuberculosis
is
much
less
common
among
individuals
in
the
United
States
than
in
other
parts
of
the
world,
an
increased
risk
of
infection
is
found
in
association
with
poor
living
conditions.
Also,
administration
of
incomplete
courses
of
antibiotics
because
of
poor
patient
compliance
has
led
to
the
emergence
of
increased
numbers
of
drug-resistant
strains.Patients
with
lymphadenitis
due
to
M.
tuberculosis
are
usually
adults
who
present
with
non-tender
lymphadenopathy,
constitutional
symptoms
(fever,
fatigue,
and
weight
loss)
and
have
associated
pulmonary
tuberculosis.
When
peripheral
lymph
nodes
are
involved,
they
tend
to
be
in
the
supraclavicular
fossa
or
posterior
cervical
triangle.
Frequently,
multiple
lymph

are
involved
bilaterally,

are

2009INTRODUCTIONTuberculous
lymphadenitis
is
the
most
common
manifestation
of
extrapulmonary
TB,
which
is
defined
as
disease
involving
structures
other
than
lung
parenchyma,
and
is
less
common
than
pulmonary
TB.
It
is
the
result
of
infection
with
the
same
organisms
that
cause
pulmonary
TB,
namely
Mycobacterium
tuberculosis,
Mycobacterium
bovis
or
Mycobacterium
africanum.
In
areas
where
TB
is
endemic
and
bovine
TB
is
well
controlled
M.
tuberculosis
is
the
most
common
cause,1,2
whereas
infection
with
M.
bovis
may
be
a
frequent
cause
in
areas
where
the
control
of
bovine
TB
is
poor
and
milk
is
not
routinely
pasteurized.3
In
developed
countries
with
low
rates
of
TB
transmission,
environmental
mycobacteria,
also
referred
to
as
non-tuberculous
mycobacteria
(NTM),
are
mainly
responsible
for
peripheral
lymphadenitis,
particularly
Mycobacterium
avium
complex
(MAC).4View

LymphadenitisTuberculous
lymphadenitis
is
the
result
of
lymph
nodal
infection
by
tuberculous
mycobacteria,
such
as
Mycobacterium
tuberculosis
or
Mycobacterium
bovis.
M.
tuberculosis
is
a
serious
global
health
problem,
with
approximately
one
third
of
the
world's
population
infected
by
this
microorganism.
In
Central
Africa,
for
example,
the
most
common
finding
among
patients
who
undergo
a
superficial
lymph
node
biopsy,
almost
all
of
whom
are
HIV+,
is
tuberculous
lymphadenitis.97
M.
tuberculosis
was
also
the
most
common
specific
cause
of
cervical
lymphadenopathy
in
children
in
a
study
from
South
Africa.98
Although
tuberculosis
is
much
less
common
among
residents
of
the
United
States
compared
to
those
in
other
parts
of
the
world,
the
number
of
cases
in
this
country
has
recently
increased
due
to
homelessness
and
poor
living
conditions.
Incomplete
courses
of
antibiotic
treatment
resulting
from
poor
patient
compliance
has
led
to
the
emergence
of
increased
numbers
of
drug-resistant
strains.99Patients
with
lymphadenitis
due
to
M.
tuberculosis
are
usually
adults
who
present
with
constitutional
symptoms
(fever,
fatigue,
and
weight
loss)
and
have
associated
pulmonary
tuberculosis.
When
peripheral
lymph
nodes
are
involved,
they
tend
to
be
in
the
supraclavicular
fossa
or
posterior
cervical
triangle.
Frequently,
multiple
lymph
nodes
are
involved
bilaterally,
and
there
are
draining
sinuses.
The
purified
protein
derivative
(PPD)
test
is
usually
strongly
positive.Lymph
nodes
in
immunocompetent
patients
show
well-formed
granulomas
composed
of
epithelioid
histiocytes
and
Langhans-type
giant
cells.
Granulomas
may
be
non-necrotizing
or
necrotizing.
Necrosis
is
typically
caseation
necrosis.
A
Ziehl-Neelsen
stain
is
used
to
identify
acid-fast
bacilli;
they
are
usually
few
in
number
in
immunocompetent
patients.
PCR
or
culture
is
needed
to
diagnose
cases
in
which
organisms
cannot
be
identified
in
tissue
sections
and
to
distinguish
definitively
between
infections
by
M.
tuberculosis
and
those
caused
by
atypical
mycobacteria.99View
