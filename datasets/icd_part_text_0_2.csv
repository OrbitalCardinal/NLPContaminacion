Cholera
is
an
acute
diarrheal
illness
caused
by
infection
of
the
intestine
with
Vibrio
cholerae
bacteria.
People
can
get
sick
when
they
swallow
food
or
water
contaminated
with
cholera
bacteria.
The
infection
is
often
mild
or
without
symptoms,
but
can
sometimes
be
severe
and
life-threatening.
A
physician
checking
a
patient
for
dehydration
About
1
in
10
people
with
cholera
will
experience
severe
symptoms,
which,
in
the
early
stages,
include:
profuse
watery
diarrhea,
sometimes
described
as
“rice-water
stools”
vomiting
thirst
leg
cramps
restlessness
or
irritability
Health
care
providers
should
look
for
signs
of
dehydration
when
examining
a
patient
with
profuse
watery
diarrhea.
These
include:
rapid
heart
rate
loss
of
skin
elasticity
dry
mucous
membranes
low
blood
pressure
People
with
severe
cholera
can
develop
severe
dehydration,
which
can
lead
to
kidney
failure.
If
left
untreated,
severe
dehydration
can
lead
to
shock,
coma,
and
death
within
hours.
Person
washing
hands
over
a
bucket
of
water.
The
profuse
diarrhea
produced
by
cholera
patients
contains
large
amounts
of
the
infectious
Vibrio
cholerae
germ
that
can
infect
others
if
swallowed.
This
can
happen
when
the
bacteria
get
on
food
or
into
water.
To
prevent
the
bacteria
from
spreading,
all
feces
(human
waste)
from
sick
persons
should
be
thrown
away
carefully
to
ensure
it
does
not
contaminate
anything
nearby.
People
caring
for
cholera
patients
must
wash
their
hands thoroughly
after
touching
anything
that
might
be
contaminated
with
patients’
feces
(poop).
When
cholera
patients
are
treated
quickly,
they
usually
recover
without
long-term
consequences.
Cholera
patients
do
not
typically
become
carriers
of
the
cholera
bacteria
after
they
recover,
but
they
get
sick
if
exposed
again.
